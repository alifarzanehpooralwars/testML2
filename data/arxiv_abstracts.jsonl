fortuity , a body of research is rapidly emerging at the crossroad of nonlinear plasmonics and graphene  @xcite .    \n very recently , the role of kerr nonlinearities in infinitely extended graphene has been studied  @xcite , notably establishing the existence of bistable solutions . in this paper \n we study theoretically an analogous kerr nonlinearity but in nanostructured graphene , specifically in nanoribbons  \n wherein plasmons , unlike in the extended counterpart , are readily excited without momentum - matching concerns , e.g.  by normally incident plane waves . \n we report an induced nonlinearity which is strongly affected by the degree of inhomogeneity of the electric fields of the plasmon  a feature which is absent in the corresponding extended system . \n furthermore , we derive a simple perturbative expression for the nonlinear resonance shifts in general graphene nanostructures , and show that it is in excellent agreement with full self - consistent calculations for moderately high field strengths . finally , we discuss the emergence of plasmonic bistability in nanoribbons under normally incident plane - wave excitation . \n first , however , we introduce the two basic components needed for a nonlinear treatment of graphene nanostructures , namely a material response model and an exposition of the resulting electromagnetic problem .    \n .35em _ material response . \n _  for photon energies @xmath0 low comparable with the fermi energy @xmath1 , the response of graphene is reasonably approximated by neglecting interband transitions . in this case , the intraband response can be derived from the boltzmann equation . to third order in the perturbing field \n the kerr - corrected conductivity , i.e.  the response oscillating at the perturbing frequency , is  @xcite @xmath2,\\ ] ] expressed in terms of the linear intraband conductivity @xmath3 with loss - rate @xmath4 , and a third - order characteristic field @xmath5 linearly related to the saturation field @xmath6 through a loss - modified frequency @xmath7 . since the kerr correction is of the self - focusing type  @xcite , its usage in finite structures with inhomogeneous fields must be augmented to include a saturating mechanism , or else suffer nonphysical run - away self - focusing  @xcite . \n here we adopt the well - known two - level saturation model , or , in other words , the @xmath8 $ ] pad approximant of @xmath9 consistent with eq .   \n @xmath10 this model reproduces the third - order result of eq .   in the @xmath11 limit , while crucially exhibiting a sensible behavior beyond this limit as well  @xcite . \n lastly , we include in eq .   \n a term @xmath12 to account for a high - field loss mechanism through two - photon absorption via the phenomenological prescription suggested by gorbach  @xcite , via the dissipative correction @xmath13 with @xmath14 estimated from measurements  @xcite .    before proceeding we briefly \n discuss the limitations of the material response assumed in eq .  . \n firstly , the disregard of interband effects limits our consideration to energies sufficiently below @xmath15 . \n secondly , nonlocality  @xcite , edge - states  @xcite , and more generally atomistic features  @xcite are excluded , though they are important at small feature sizes . consequently , we restrict our considerations to nanostructures of characteristic dimensions @xmath16 where these effects only weakly perturb the intraband approximation .    \n .35em _ interacting response . \n _  in the quasistatic limit , the interacting response of graphene can be deduced from three elements ; the coulomb law , the continuity equation , and the current - field relationship as specified by a conductivity - model . for a nanostructure defined by a two - dimensional domain @xmath17 ( e.g.  at @xmath18 ) , \n these elements combine to form an integro - differential equation for either the induced density or the total potential @xmath19 . here \n we choose the latter  @xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] expressed in dimensionless coordinates @xmath21^{\\text{\\textsc{t}}}$ ] normalized by a characteristic length @xmath22 , with the coulomb interaction @xmath23 , and with differential operators @xmath24^{\\text{\\textsc{t}}}$ ] . \n the conductivity @xmath9 implicitly depends on frequency  and in a nonlinear treatment also on the total field @xmath25 . \n the spatial dependence of the conductivity can be conveniently expressed via a dimensionless occupation function @xmath26 with @xmath27 denoting the average linear conductivity across @xmath17 . \n introducing operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] casts eq .   as an eigenvalue problem for the composite operator @xmath30 @xmath31 with eigenvalues @xmath32 , dictating the permitted eigenfrequencies @xmath33 \n . operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 find simple matrix - forms in a discretized real - space basis in both the general 2d case as well as in the 1d ribbon case , see supplemental material ( sm ) . \n the operator @xmath35 is constructed so as to account explicitly for a boundary condition of vanishing normal current ( or , equivalently , for the conductivity - discontinuity ) at the boundary @xmath36 . in the presence of an external potential @xmath37 , the eigenvalue problem in eq .   becomes an inhomogeneous equation through the addition to the right - hand - side of a source - term @xmath38 . to solve the nonlinear problem , with @xmath9 , and hence @xmath39 and @xmath35 , \n depending on the total electric field locally , we solve the nonlinear system iteratively until self - consistency is reached , exploiting at each iteration - step the computational efficiency associated with linear systems  @xcite , see sm .     \n ranges from negligible ( black ) , i.e. linear , through @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( lightest blue ) in steps of @xmath42 ( increasing along arrow ) . for the first five @xmath43 , \n we indicate in dashed red the corresponding analytical estimate , see eq .  . \n for the monopole , only the linear calculation is shown . \n the region of significant interband - modification is illustrated in shaded gray . \n inset schematically depicts a single graphene nanoribbon . \n field intensity , @xmath44 , contour maps for the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n colormap ranges from maximal ( dark ) to minimal ( light ) logarithmically , with contours separated by factors of 1.5 , 1.75 , 2 , and 2.25 for dipole , tripole , quadrupole , and pentapole cases , respectively . \n sparklines below maps depict the variation of @xmath47 along the ribbon , with maximal and minimal values indicated.,height=296 ]    with the formal premise established , we next specialize to the case of nanoribbons , translationally invariant along @xmath48 and of finite extent @xmath22 along @xmath49 ; a system which has already attracted much attention in the linear case  @xcite . as a consequence of translational symmetry \n , eigensolutions can be expanded in a momentum basis according to @xmath50 . of key interest \n is the evolution of the eigenenergies with momentum @xmath51 ( here dimensionless ; conventional units via @xmath52 ) , i.e.  the dispersion relation @xmath53  and subsequently the response of the system to external fields .    \n .35em _ eigenmodes and nonlinear dispersion . \n _  for low field strengths , i.e.  in the linear regime with @xmath39 independent of @xmath25 , the eigenmodes @xmath54 of eq .   are solely geometry dependent  but scale invariant  with associated eigenfrequencies @xmath55 dictated by @xmath56 , allowing in the linear intraband approximation the simple scaling relation @xmath57  @xcite . under significant nonlinear interaction , however , the eigenvalues @xmath54 are field - dependent , and , by extension , scale - dependent due to the self - consistent nature of the problem . in fig .  \n [ fig : disprel](a ) we investigate the dispersion relation of the first few eigenmodes of a single @xmath58 nanoribbon for different ribbon - averaged field strengths @xmath59 . \n the most apparent impact of nonlinearity is a redshift of all resonances . \n this is readily appreciated from the negativity of the kerr correction . \n indeed , the shift can be well - approximated by perturbation theory for any general structure : denoting by @xmath60 and @xmath61 the _ linear _ response eigenenergies and eigenfields [ with @xmath62 the nonlinear eigenenergies are , to lowest order , approximately ( see sm ) @xmath63 with the averages taken over @xmath64 . \n the approximation is excellent for moderately high fields , see dashed red lines of fig .  \n [ fig : disprel](a ) , though , naturally , inaccurate for the largest considered fields due to the disregard of the self - consistent aspects of the nonlinear perturbation . \n the approximation also reveals the important role played by the inhomogeneity of @xmath25 , or equivalently @xmath39 , for the nonlinear strength since @xmath65 for inhomogeneous fields .    in fig .  \n [ fig : disprel](b ) we explore this point further , by depicting the modal character and inhomogeneous nature of the plasmonic modes . \n the modal labels are chosen from the perspective of the induced charge density , @xmath66 , of the @xmath67th mode , with the monopole , dipole , tripole , quadrupole , and pentapole ( @xmath68 , respectively ) exhibiting @xmath67 nodes of @xmath66 . \n modes of even @xmath67 are optically dark , owing to a vanishing dipole moment , and remain optically dark also under nonlinear perturbations ( which preserves the system symmetry ) . \n the monopole violates charge conservation along @xmath49 [ but not along @xmath69 for @xmath70 , is optically dark , and consistently does not converge at higher fields ; as a consequence , we depict only its linear dispersion . \n the variation of the occupation function @xmath39 under large fields is highlighted in the insets of fig .  \n [ fig : disprel](b ) . \n the strong spatial variation of the conductive profile , up to 50% for the considered @xmath43 , is a direct consequence of the strongly inhomogeneous nature of plasmons . despite these significant spatial variations of @xmath39 , the corresponding modal profiles away from the ribbon are highly similar under linear and nonlinear circumstances , since their character is dictated chiefly by the nodal character of @xmath66 .     as a function of energy @xmath0 , for varying incident field strengths @xmath71 ( as indicated above each spectrum ) . \n each spectrum is offset vertically by 5 units . \n two ribbon widths @xmath72 and @xmath73 are examined . \n regions of bistability are delimited by dashed arrows which indicate the ramping direction . \n material parameters are as in fig .  \n [ fig : disprel ] . \n [ fig : pw_spectral ] ]    .35em _ plane - wave excitation and bistability . \n _  having considered the dispersion of eigenmodes , we next turn our attention to the response of the system due to a normally incident plane wave , polarized along @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 , corresponding to vanishing @xmath51 . in addition to the power absorbed from the incident wave , the induced and total electric fields are of primary interest  here \n we focus on the latter . for reasons of numerical efficiency , and as we shall see , physical necessity , we compute for each separate energy the response by an initial linear calculation , followed by a ramping of the incident field strength . \n specifically , for fixed @xmath0 , we consider a ramp - array @xmath76 with @xmath77 and with @xmath78 sufficiently small to be considered a linear perturbation . \n starting from @xmath78 we compute associated solutions and proceed , generally , to field strength @xmath79 with initial guesses on @xmath80 and @xmath81 obtained from the @xmath67th solution . \n this defines the upward ramp , corresponding to slowly turning the incident intensity up . upon reaching @xmath82 \n we invert the procedure and follow a downward ramp , in the pattern @xmath83 , corresponding to slowly turning the intensity down .    in fig .  \n [ fig : pw_spectral ] we examine the spectral response of ribbons of widths @xmath72 and @xmath73 under different excitation strengths , i.e.  under varying @xmath71 . \n for moderately high @xmath71 the linear lorentzian resonance is asymmetrically perturbed , slightly broadened , and redshifted . \n furthermore , the upward and downward ramps to @xmath71 give identical spectra . \n as @xmath71 is increased further , these perturbations intensify . \n however , in certain frequency ranges the response to upward and downward ramps toward @xmath71 differ ( regions delimited by dashed arrows ) ; a trademark of bistability . \n similar features were discussed for extended graphene in ref .   using the kerr model of eq .   and in ref .   for finite systems using a phenomenological anharmonic model . \n the primary extension here is the full self - consistent accounting of the inhomogeneous nonlinear conductive profile arising in nanostructured systems . for comparison \n , we note that the bistability studied here is achievable at much larger energies than in the extended system , where it is restricted to @xmath84 under normal incidence ( with @xmath85 )  @xcite . here , bistability is evident in the dipole mode for both @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but also visible for the quadrupole mode for @xmath58 . in both cases , \n the area traced by the bistable region initially increases with @xmath71 and then decreases due to saturation and increased absorption .     \n nanoribbon excited by a plane wave @xmath86 ( material parameters are as in fig .  \n [ fig : disprel ] ) .  \n linear response field - enhancement spectrum versus energy . \n selected energies are highlighted by colored markers , and the linear resonance energy @xmath87 is labeled explicitly .  \n hysteresis curves at fixed energy [ corresponding colorwise to those highlighted in ( a ) ] for total field @xmath43 versus incident field @xmath71 . \n bistable regions are indicated by shading and delimited by energy -

field maps are specified by corresponding triangles in ( b ) . \n sparklines , defined as in fig .  \n [ fig : disprel](b ) , indicate the range and variation of @xmath47.[fig : hysteresis ] ]    the history dependence of the response is further examined in fig .  \n [ fig : hysteresis](b ) , depicting hysteresis curves of @xmath71 vs. @xmath43 ( normalized to the frequency - dependent saturation field ) at a selection of fixed frequencies as indicated in the linear spectrum of fig .  \n [ fig : hysteresis](a ) . at energies \n far from the linear resonance at @xmath87 the response @xmath43 relates linearly with @xmath71 . \n as the energy is increased towards @xmath87 , a nonlinear discrepancy develops with increasing @xmath71 which eventually gives way to a discontinuous jump at a critical field strength @xmath90 , indicated for a selected energy in fig .  \n [ fig : hysteresis](b ) . \n as @xmath71 is reduced on the downward ramp , its response initially traces out that of the upward ramp , but departs from its upward correspondent after @xmath90 and eventually undergoes a discontinuous jump at @xmath91 after which the initial path is retraced . \n the hysteresis area , indicated by shaded areas , increases with positive @xmath92 ( though @xmath93 similarly increases , delaying the onset of hysteresis ) , but vanishes for @xmath94 due to the redshifting of the resonance with @xmath71 . \n the onset of bistability is reached for incident field strengths considerably below @xmath95 ; this fortuity is of course a result of plasmonic field - enhancement of the total field .    \n lastly , we comment on the field profiles of the excitations . \n first we highlight the linear response at energies just below and above @xmath87 , indicated by red and green markers in fig .  \n [ fig : hysteresis](a ) and  [ fig : hysteresis](c ) . \n the field profile exhibits a well - known @xmath96 phase - shift between the two energies , a result which can be appreciated e.g.  by inspection of the linear harmonic - oscillator polarizability @xmath97^{-1}$ ] which exhibits a sign - change of its real part as @xmath33 traverses @xmath98 : as a result , the induced dipole @xmath99 changes sign for @xmath100 , and correspondingly so for the induced fields . \n a similar sign change is observed in the bistable comparison , see black - framed modes in fig .  \n [ fig : hysteresis](c ) . \n again , the origin of the sign change can be appreciated from a polarizability consideration by including a third - order anharmonic term to the harmonic oscillator model  @xcite , see sm .    \n .35em _ summary and discussion . \n _  in this paper we have analyzed the impact of kerr nonlinearity on the plasmonic response of graphene nanostructures , specifically for nanoribbons . \n the key distinction of nanostructures compared to the corresponding extended system arises from the strongly inhomogeneous fields of localized plasmonic excitations , which in turn incur an inhomogeneous conductive profile . \n we have derived a simple analytic expression , eq .  , which approximates the nonlinear resonance shifts , while accounting for both inhomogeneity and overall amplitude of the nonlinear perturbation . \n the characteristic field of the kerr nonlinearity in graphene is the saturation field @xmath95 . \n however , significant nonlinear interaction can be achieved near plasmonic resonances even for much weaker incident fields owing to plasmonic field enhancement . finally , we discussed the existence of a plasmonic bistability in nanoribbons under normal incidence .    \n the applications of optical bistabilities are well - known and long - pursued  @xcite , with implications particularly in optical switching . \n indeed , a range of platforms have been scrutinized for this purpose , in recent years e.g.  in photonic crystal cavities ( pcc ) where nonlinearities are enhanced by large @xmath101-factors and light - slowdown  @xcite . whether graphene can further the state - of - the - art in this mature field remains to be seen  @xcite . \n we expect , however , that a very profitable avenue for progress exists in hybrid approaches , utilizing e.g.  pcc and graphene in unison  as has in fact been explored experimentally  @xcite , albeit without taking advantage of the resonant plasmonic nonlinearity described herein . a simultaneous tuning of both cavity _ and \n _ plasmonic resonance should allow for maximal nonlinear manifestation in such systems . \n advances in this direction requires improved understanding of nonlinearities in nanostructures ; the present work constitutes one such effort . \n several features , however , remain unexplored , underscoring the fertility and richness of the field . \n for example , from a semiclassical perspective , barring atomistic approaches  @xcite , questions remain relating to the role of interband nonlinearities  @xcite , nonlocality , and the effective role of edge states .    in closing \n , we mention a final question of singular practical relevance , namely damage thresholds . \n so far , to the best of our knowledge , measurements do not exist in the infrared , but in the optical domain  @xcite the reported thresholds fall in the rather broad range from @xmath102 in fs - pulsed operation  @xcite to just @xmath103 for hour - long continuous wave operation  @xcite . \n for comparison , the saturation field at @xmath104 is @xmath105 . \n though direct comparison is impossible , in part due to frequency range , pulse conditions , and the uncertain impact of field enhancement , this highlights that even resonantly enhanced nonlinearities in graphene walk a narrow road  not unlike previous contenders for large nonlinearities . \n given the promising results presented herein , however , we believe the journey will be worth the effort .    \n 1em _ acknowledgments . \n _  the center for nanostructured graphene is sponsored by the danish national research foundation , project dnrf58 . \n this work was also supported by the danish council for independent research , project 1323 -

{"id": 71, "abstract": " under special conditions bacteria excrete an attractant and aggregate . \n the high density regions initially collapse into cylindrical structures , which subsequently destabilize and break up into spherical aggregates . \n this paper presents a theoretical description of the process , from the structure of the collapsing cylinder to the spacing of the final aggregates . \n we show that cylindrical collapse involves a delicate balance in which bacterial attraction and diffusion nearly cancel , leading to corrections to the collapse laws expected from dimensional analysis . \n the instability of a collapsing cylinder is composed of two distinct stages : initially , slow modulations to the cylinder develop , which correspond to a variation of the collapse time along the cylinder axis . ultimately , one point on the cylinder pinches off . at this final stage of the instability , a front propagates from the pinch into the remainder of the cylinder . \n the spacing of the resulting spherical aggregates is determined by the front propagation .    \n -0.5 in    the formation of a singularity  the divergence of a physical quantity in finite time  is central to diverse fields@xcite , including nonlinear optics , gravitational collapse , and fluid mechanics . \n the structure of singularities has been worked out in many examples for which a physical quantity blows up at a spatial point@xcite . \n typically , singular dynamics are self - similar : the characteristic scale separation between the singular and regular parts of the solution leads to the slaving of the spatial structure to the time dependence via scaling laws \n . the situation can be more complicated when many singularities form collectively and simultaneously . in this paper \n we analyze a simple example for which multiple singularities form in a short time . \n this work was motivated by a recent experiment in bacterial chemotaxis@xcite .    \n the experimental observation is shown in figure [ elena ] . in the first panel a diffuse cloud of _ escherichia coli _ covers the depth of a petri dish filled with agar . \n the environment is prepared so that the _ e. coli _ excrete an attractant ; each bacterium attracts all the other bacteria , and a cloud can collapse . in the second panel , \n the diffuse cloud collapses as a cylindrical structure , with highest bacterial density on the cylinder axis . in the final panel , \n the cylinder breaks down into spherical aggregates . in this paper \n we analyze this process , by constructing a similarity solution to describe the cylindrical collapse of bacteria , and then analyzing its stability .    \n = 2.5 in    chemotaxis in _ \n e. coli _ is an excellent model system for studying singularity formation . \n the biochemical response of _ \n e. coli _ to a changing environment has been thoroughly characterized @xcite over the past twenty - five years , so we understand how the bacteria sense and respond to their environment . as a consequence , \n it is possible to write down a `` first principles '' hydrodynamic theory for the motion of many bacteria @xcite in which the response coefficients are measurable . \n quantitative comparison between theory and experiment is possible , and any discrepancies can be traced directly to the biochemistry of individual bacteria@xcite . \n the application to singularity formation arose from the recent discovery by budrene and berg @xcite of an assay in which _ \n e. coli _ excrete aspartate , an amino acid which is also an attractant for nearby bacteria . \n attractant diffusion drives aggregation because it leads to an effective force between individual bacteria : a higher density of bacteria in a given region leads to a higher attractant concentration , which then attracts more bacteria .    \n the initial interest in the budrene - berg experiment was stimulated by the symmetrical patterns that form when chemotactic bacteria are seeded in the center of a petri dish , as shown in their papers @xcite .    \n several theories have been developed for these patterns , most of which @xcite view the pattern formation as resulting from a linear instability of a ( 1 dimensional ) travelling wave of bacteria . \n recently , it was pointed out @xcite that each of the aggregates in a a pattern corresponds to a density singularity in the hydrodynamic description of the bacteria . \n therefore the pattern formation depends crucially on the dynamics of singularity formation . \n singularities in chemotaxis were anticipated by nanudjiah@xcite and childress and percus@xcite in studies of mathematical models of chemotaxis . \n an important feature , understood first by childress and percus , is that chemotactic collapse has a _ critical dimension _ : although collapse to an infinite density sheet is mathematically impossible , collapse to infinite density lines and points both can occur . \n it was argued in @xcite that these facts crucially affect the patterns that can form .    \n in particular , figure 1 shows a step in the formation of the aggregates . \n the initially diffuse band ( filling the depth of agar ) can not form a singularity by collapsing only one of its dimensions to zero thickness ; instead it collapses into a cylinder ( contracting two of its dimensions simultaneously ) . \n the cylinder later destabilizes to form aggregates , for which all three dimensions contract simultaneously . \n models @xcite viewing aggregate formation as the linear instability of a band can not account for these experimental observations . \n these two different pictures of aggregates form lead to different conclusions about which biochemical parameters set the wavelength and structure of the patterns . \n for the `` collapsing cylinder '' mechanism advocated here , the characteristics of the pattern are set by the same biochemical cutoff which prevents an aggregate from reaching infinite density .    \n cylindrical collapse is also important when a _ uniform _ density cloud of bacteria breaks into aggregates . \n linear stability analysis of the uniform density state predicts that the cloud directly breaks down into spherical aggregates . \n however , experiments@xcite find that the the clumping is hierarchical : the uniform density cloud first collapses as cylindrical structures which then break into spherical aggregates . \n an important unsolved question is to explain the geometry of the high density regions during collapse , and to predict the distribution of final aggregates .    in this paper , \n we use a combination of simulations and asymptotics to describe the breakdown of a cylinder in of three principal steps ( figure [ cylsketch ] ) . \n first , the bacteria collapse as a cylinder towards a line of infinite density . in the second step , uniformity along the cylinder axis \n is broken , and a singularity develops at a single point . \n finally , the remaining cylinder breaks up producing a sequence of spherical aggregates . \n our primary conclusion connecting the present theory with the experiments is that the spacing between the aggregates in patterns such as figure 2 is determined by the local depletion of chemicals which make aspartate production possible . according to budrene@xcite , \n the most likely candidate for this is the overhead oxygen concentration in the cell . \n this prediction is qualitatively in accord with the experiments ; moreover this parameter dependence could be directly tested in future experiments , and would serve to discriminate this theory from those based on pure linear stability analysis .    in the following section , we review the basics of chemotaxis , and discuss details necessary to understand the budrene - berg experiments . \n section 2 describes the cylindrical collapse of the bacteria . \n cylindrical collapse ( in which two dimensions of the cloud contract simultaneously ) is a critical case @xcite , for which diffusion and attraction nearly exactly balance . \n this criticality has complicated previous attempts to solve the collapse ; a recent treatment of collapse in the 2d nonlinear schrodinger equation @xcite inspired our solution . in section 3 \n we perform a stability analysis of a collapsing cylinder . \n perturbations to the cylinder can be described by a `` phase equation '' for the singular time@xcite . \n solutions to this envelope equation explain full numerical simulations of a modulated cylinder . \n section 4 describes the final stage of the breakdown of the cylinder , after the cylinder has pinched off at a point . \n stability analysis predicts the breakup of the remaining column of bacteria , a situation analogous to a propagating rayleigh instability in a liquid column@xcite . \n appendices describe our numerical methods , and fill in the details of the calculations .

energy parton through the qgp are wakes and mach cones which may be observable as conical flow and shock waves in particle correlations @xcite .    \n in electromagnetic plasmas wakes are a well known phenomena . \n theoretically they can be investigated by considering transport equations . in the collisionless case \n they follow from the dielectric functions by solving the vlasov equation together with the poisson equation . \n it has been shown in this way that wakes are also created in a qgp , leading eventually to attractive potentials and mach cones as well known in plasma physics ( see below ) . \n attractive potentials between partons might lead to bound states and may modify the @xmath1 suppression pattern @xcite . \n in the static case , i.e. for a parton at rest , the wake potential reduces to the usual yukawa potential describing debye screening @xcite .    here \n we want to extend these investigations by taking into account collisions in the qgp . \n for this purpose we start from the boltzmann equation approximating the collision term by the bgk description @xcite , allowing an analytic expression for the dielectric functions @xcite . in this approach \n the collision term is replaced by a momentum independent collision rate which we take as a parameter . \n this model has been used to study dispersion relations @xcite and instabilities @xcite in a collisional qgp . \n whereas the changes in the case of the dispersion relations are marginal - however the longitudinal plasma modes cross the light cone in a collisional plasma - , instabilities can be suppressed efficiently due to collisions . in the case of complex plasmas , \n i.e. , low - temperature discharge plasmas with microparticles such as dust grains @xcite , wake potentials due to ion flow , leading to an attractive force between the negatively charged microparticles , are investigated intensively ( see e.g. @xcite ) . also collisions between the ions and the neutral gas \n have been taken into account in this case and have been shown to truncate the wakes effectively @xcite . in general the collisions modify the wake potential by decelerating the ions . therefore the positive ion cloud , responsible for the attractive part of the wake potential , is concentrated nearer to the dust grain , causing a narrower but deeper potential well .    \n the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions of a collisional qgp within the bgk approach are given by  @xcite , @xmath2\\left ( 1 -

like structure , and wave excitation has been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite in the collisionless case . \n however , in the case of collisions these structures are smeared out and less pronounced for increasing @xmath3 . \n we interpret this as the fact that the collisions , leading to thermalization , reduce the anisotropy caused by the perturbation of the moving charge in the qgp .    \n the wake potential is given by ( see appendix ) @xmath29 it is of the same form as in the collisionless case , where it can be shown that in cylindrical coordinates it reduces to @xcite @xmath30\\,{\\rm{re } } \\ , \\epsilon_l \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sin \\left[\\omega\\left(\\frac{z}{v}-t\\right)\\right]\\,{\\rm{im } } \\,\\epsilon_l \\biggr \\}\\ , . \n \\label{potcyl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in figs.3 and 4 the wake potentials scaled with respect to @xmath19 are shown for a parton with a given color charge @xmath8 for velocities @xmath25 and @xmath26 and various values for the collision rate from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . \n it can be seen that collisions modify the strength and the structure of the wake potential significantly . again , as in the case of the induced charge density the potential structure is washed out due to the collisions between the partons in the qgp \n . however , the potential becomes also stronger at finite collision rates , indicating that collisions in the qgp can enhance the attractive and repulsive parts of the interaction potential of a fast parton as in the case of non - relativistic plasmas . \n in particular , the attractive part behind the particle becomes deeper which might lead to an even stronger binding of diquark states propagating through the qgp as discussed in ref.@xcite . \n ( note that the induced charge density and wake potential diverge for point - like particles at the origin as in the static case corresponding to a yukawa potential . )    in conclusion , we have applied the bgk approach in order to study the influence of collisions on the wake formation in the qgp . \n clearly , this approach allows only qualitative statements . \n a consistent qcd approach , in which for example the collision rate are momentum dependent , is beyond the scope of this work . keeping this in mind , we regard the ( momentum independent ) collision rate in our model as a free parameter . anyway \n , our model demonstrates clearly that collisions in the qgp lead to a significant modification of wakes created by fast partons compared to the collisionless case . \n in particular , the wake structure is less pronounced . \n hence possible observable effects such as the conical flow and wave excitations will be reduced . on the other hand , \n the attractive potential well becomes deeper . \n similar effects of collisions have been observed in electromagnetic plasmas .    * \n acknowledgments * we would like to thank m. strickland for helpful discussions . m.h.t . \n would like to thank a. ivlev for information on wakes in complex plasmas . \n mgm and rr are also thankful to s. mallik for useful discussions .

{"id": 222, "abstract": " the one - dimensional electron gas exhibits spin - charge separation and power - law spectral responses to many experimentally relevant probes . ordering in a quasi one - dimensional system \n is necessarily associated with a dimensional crossover , at which sharp quasiparticle peaks , with small spectral weight , emerge from the incoherent background . using methods of abelian bosonization \n , we derive asymptotically correct expressions for the spectral changes induced by this crossover . \n comparison is made with experiments on the high temperature superconductors , which are electronically quasi one - dimensional on a local scale .    \n epsf    60a@xmath0c@xmath1  s    2    in this paper , we consider the spectral signatures of dimensional crossover in the continuum theory of a quasi one - dimensional superconductor . \n this problem is of interest in its own right and for application to materials which are structurally quasi one - dimensional , such as the bechgaard salts ( organic superconductors ) . \n we believe that it is also interesting as a contribution to the theory of the high temperature superconductors . \n although structurally these materials are quasi two - dimensional , there is both theoretical and experimental evidence@xcite of a substantial range of temperatures in which `` stripe '' correlations make the electronic structure locally quasi one - dimensional , a phenomenon we have labeled `` dynamical dimension reduction . '' \n similarly , the et versions of organic superconductors are two - dimensional doped antiferromagnets , which we expect to show similar behavior . \n more generally , the high temperature superconducting state emerges from a non - fermi liquid normal state , often with a normal - state pseudogap . \n the quasi one - dimensional superconductor is the only solvable case in which such an evolution can be traced , theoretically .    \n a quasi one - dimensional system can be thought of as an array of `` chains '' , in which the electron dynamics within a chain is characterized by energy scales large compared to the electronic couplings between chains . \n since a one - dimensional system can not undergo a finite temperature phase transition , any ordering transition with a finite critical temperature @xmath2 is necessarily associated with a dimensional crossover . \n the electronic properties at temperatures ( or energies ) large compared to @xmath2 can be understood by ignoring the interchain coupling , while at lower temperatures or energies , the behavior is that of a three dimensional system .    in the one dimensional electron gas@xcite ( 1deg ) , as a consequence of spin - charge separation , the elementary excitations are collective modes with unusual quantum numbers and topological properties : the charge excitations are best understood as sound - like density - wave phasons ( or , in dual representation , superconducting quasi - goldstone modes ) when the system is gapless , and as charge solitons with charge @xmath3 and spin 0 when a charge gap is induced . \n ( the precise meaning of the soliton  \n charge \" is a quantized unit of chirality ; see eq . \n ( [ eq : nc ] ) and the subsequent discussion . ) \n similarly , the spin excitations of a spin - gapped system are spin solitons with charge 0 and spin @xmath4 . when the elementary excitations do not have the quantum numbers of the experimentally accessible excited states , spectral functions do not exhibit sharp peaks corresponding to a well defined mode with a definite dispersion relation , @xmath5 . \n the single hole spectral function , @xmath6 , which is measured in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , involves excited states with charge @xmath7 and spin 1/2 , which thus consist of at least one charge soliton and one spin soliton . \n the dynamic spin structure factor @xmath8 , measured by neutron scattering , involves excited states with spin 1 , which thus consist of two spin solitons . \n ( we will see in section [ sec : lowt]c that , in fact , the relevant excited states contain two spin solitons and at least two charge antisolitons . )    below @xmath2 , where the system is three dimensional , we will show that the solitonic excitations of the 1deg are confined in multiplets with quantum numbers that are simply related to those of the electron . for the case of three dimensional charge - density wave ordering \n , this has been known for some time . for the case of the superconductor , it is related to the fact , noted recently by salkola and schrieffer,@xcite that either a spin soliton or a charge soliton induces a @xmath9-kink in the superconducting correlations . as a consequence of confinement , there is a finite probability of creating a final state consisting of a single bound spin and charge soliton pair in an arpes experiment . \n this will show up as a coherent ( delta - function ) piece in the zero temperature @xmath10 .    in this paper \n , we show that the coherent piece of the single particle spectral functions has a weight which vanishes in the neighborhood of @xmath11 in proportion to a positive power of the interchain josephson energy . \n it is this fact , that the _ spectral weight _ of the coherent piece is strongly temperature dependent below @xmath11 , rather than either the energy or the lifetime of the normal mode , which is a new feature that emerges from our analysis . \n it is highly reminiscent of behavior observed in arpes@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite measurements on the high temperature superconductors . \n we have also identified a new resonant feature in the spin spectrum of a quasi one - dimensional superconductor that emerges at temperatures well below @xmath11 .    \n if the 1deg remains gapless down to @xmath11 , the superconducting transition is bcs - like , in the sense that both pairing and phase coherence occur at the same time . in this case \n both are induced by the interchain josephson tunnelling . \n we will mainly be concerned with the case in which a sort of `` pairing '' , _ i.e. _ the opening of a spin gap @xmath12 , occurs in the 1d regime well above @xmath11 . in this case \n @xmath11 is primarily associated with phase ordering , and its scale is set by the superfluid density,@xcite rather than by the zero temperature single particle gap scale , @xmath13 . in such circumstances the superconducting state , even at very low temperatures , maintains a memory of the separation of charge and spin which is a feature of the ( 1d ) normal state . \n the unique `` coherence length '' of a bcs superconductor is replaced by two distinct correlation lengths@xcite : a spin length , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the spin velocity , and a charge length , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 2@xmath11 .    \n the remainder of the paper is divided into two self - contained parts ; in sections [ sec : bos]-[sec : lowt ] we derive asymptotically exact results for the spectral properties of a quasi one - dimensional superconductor in the limit of weak interchain coupling . in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize the principal results and discuss their application to experiment , especially in the high temperature superconductors . \n the reader who is interested only in results , not their derivation , can skip the intervening sections .    \n the model we study is defined by the hamiltonian h=_jdx h_j + h_j , [ eq : h ] where the sum runs over chains , @xmath18 is the hamiltonian of the 1deg on chain @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the josephson coupling between chains . in secs . \n [ sec : bos]-[sec : intt ] , we consider the single chain problem ( @xmath21 ) . the problem is formulated using abelian bosonization in sec . \n [ sec : bos ] . \n next , we discuss the spectral functions for the 1deg without ( section [ sec : hight ] ) and with ( section [ sec : intt ] ) a spin gap - explicit expressions for various quantities in the presence of a spin gap are reported here for the first time of which we are aware . in section [ sec : lowt ] , we extend these results to the case in which the most relevant interchain coupling is the josephson tunnelling . an adiabatic approximation , which is exact in the limit where @xmath22 , replaces the spin - charge separation of the purely 1d problem as the central feature of the spectrum - this section contains our principal new results . \n applications to are described in sec . \n [ sec : summary ] . \n various appendices expand upon the derivations in section [ sec : lowt ] .

based pseudo - random number generator ( prng ) , while in most application areas , prngs are not enough . \n so far , it is commonly accepted that pure quantum process is the only solution for truly random number generator ( trng ) . \n recently , two kinds of quantum noise of laser , phase noise and relaxation oscillation noise , are chosen to generate truly random bit sequence with high generation rate @xcite . \n phase noise , directly measured using self - delayed homodyne detection @xcite , can be used to generate random bits with good randomness , but the final random number generation rate is limited by the laser linewidth ; relaxation oscillation noise , amplified by chaotic behavior , can be used to achieve ultra - high random bit generation rate @xcite , but the random bits generated by chaotic laser involve more classical noise ( not truly random ) and so can not have good results in three - sigma randomness tests @xcite . to generate an original random bit sequence , \n either an oscilloscope @xcite or an analog - digital - converter ( adc ) @xcite is available for high speed multi - bit per measurement data recording , but due to data size limitation in one scan process , using oscilloscope will reduce the generation rate for long random bit sequence . \n multi - bit per measurement method increases the random number generation rate but introduces additional correlations . \n the proper number of bits extracted from the recorded data can be estimated by randomness evaluation .    in this letter , we propose a simple method to evaluate the randomness from the entropy point of view , which gives the upper and lower estimations of the maximal bits that can be extracted from one measurement . \n the laser phase noise ( gaussian random variable @xcite ) measurement based trng scheme is adopted , where a single - mode vertical cavity surface emitting laser ( vcsel ) is used and sampled by an adc . \n after entropy amplification by bit extraction , we realize a @xmath1 mbps trng , which passes three standard statistical tests . \n note that this bit extraction method is also applicable for other random sources .    \n the schematic setup is shown in fig . \n [ setup ] ( see also @xcite ) and the delayed self - homodyne method is used to measure the phase noise of the vcsel . \n the beat signal of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is detected by the avalanche photodetector ( apd ) and sampled at @xmath4 mhz by the 8-bit binary adc . \n when the delay time is much longer than the coherence time of laser ( @xmath5 ) , the autocorrelation function of the laser electric field is eliminated @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the laser linewidth . in this case , the beat signal of these two mutually independent laser fields can be considered as a good candidate to implement trng .    since the phase noise of the laser is inversely proportional to the laser power , while the classical noises are laser power independent @xcite , we choose working current just above the threshold current to ensure that the phase noise is dominant and the true randomness can thus be guaranteed . in experiment , a @xmath9 nm vcsel laser works at 1.4 ma ( threshold current 1.3 ma ) , and its linewidth is @xmath10 mhz ( @xmath11 ns ) . with delay time @xmath12 ns , the power spectral density of the beat signal is shown in fig . \n [ spectrum ] ( a ) . in fig . \n [ spectrum ] ( b ) , we calculate the autocorrelation function @xmath13 from the power density spectrum in fig . \n [ spectrum ] ( a ) using wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite . without any post - processing , the autocorrelation of the laser source sampled by 8-bit adc at @xmath14 mhz ( time delay @xmath15 ns ) is smaller than @xmath16 .    due to the dependence on the external parameters in the experiment , \n the sampled original data digitized by an 8-bit adc is biased . to reduce the bias \n , we perform a simple exclusive - or post - processing between every two 8-bit original data , which is a common method to improve the randomness of rng @xcite . after the bit extraction , the histogram of the data \n is shown in fig . \n [ histogram ] ( a ) , well fitted with a gaussian profile . \n since truly randomness should have a uniform distributed histogram with shannon entropy of 8 bits per byte , the randomness in this original data is limited by the correlation within the byte . to evaluate the randomness , \n we calculate shannon entropy using the experiment results ( histogram data ) : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the probability of the data in the @xmath19 digitized bin ( totally @xmath20 bins ) . \n this can roughly be viewed as that this data can extract @xmath21 random bits out of every byte using appropriate , yet maybe complicated bit extraction post - processing . to assure that shannon entropy can evaluate the randomness of the source , we calculate the entropy of laser source according to its gaussian fitting curve ( fig . \n [ histogram ] ( a ) ) using @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the standard deviation of gaussian profile . \n the result of the entropy of the laser source is @xmath24 bits per byte , and experiments show these two values of shannon entropy get closer when the size of the data is larger .    \n to avoid complicated post - processing , adopting @xmath0-least - significant - bit ( @xmath0-lsb ) out of each byte is an efficient method to amplify the randomness . but this method is not strong in eliminating the correlation , and extracting @xmath25-lsb according to shannon entropy can not pass the random tests . \n therefore , we change the randomness indicator to min -

{"id": 360, "abstract": " we develop a theory of topological transitions in a floquet topological insulator , using graphene irradiated by circularly polarized light as a concrete realization . \n we demonstrate that a hallmark signature of such transitions in a static system , i.e. metallic bulk transport with conductivity of order @xmath0 , is substantially suppressed at some floquet topological transitions in the clean system . \n we determine the conditions for this suppression analytically and confirm our results in numerical simulations . \n remarkably , introducing disorder dramatically enhances this transport by several orders of magnitude .    _ \n introduction_.topological insulators exhibit a variety of phenomena usually associated with quantum behaviors of electrons in strong magnetic fields , even though no such fields are present  @xcite . \n a characteristic aspect of these phenomena is the so - called bulk - boundary correspondence due to the appearance of robust states at the edges of the system , whose precise structure is determined by the topology of the bulk state . in particular , edge transport in a four - terminal geometry  @xcite can reveal the change in bulk topology by yielding sharply different results depending on the number and chirality of the edge states in different gapped states . at a topological phase transition \n the bulk band gap closes and the low - energy dynamics is controlled by a gapless state . \n therefore , bulk metallic behavior also marks the change in the topological state .    \n much of the search for these remarkable systems has focused on materials with strong spin - orbit coupling . \n recently , it has been appreciated that periodically driven systems can exhibit a rich topological phase diagram as the frequency , amplitude , and other properties of the drive are tuned  @xcite . in this way , a much simpler system can support topological states even if the static system does not @xcite . a prime candidate for realizing such a floquet topological insulator is graphene  @xcite in the presence of circularly polarized light  @xcite or other temporally periodic potentials @xcite . \n experimental evidence for a similar floquet state on the surface of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 has been reported in ref .  . \n the resulting topological state is intrinsically dynamical and the correspondence between bulk and edge state structure is more subtle than in the static system . \n thus , a natural question arises as to the signature of the critical state that is realized at the transition between floquet topological states .    in this paper \n we show that while the low - energy critical dynamics in irradiated graphene is controlled by a massless dirac hamiltonian , the metallic transport across the system can be _ substantially _ suppressed , with conductivity much smaller than that of static systems , which is of order @xmath0  @xcite . \n hence , some topological transitions in floquet topological insulators may be concealed in the bulk system while the edge signatures are intact . \n remarkably and counterintuitively , disorder can increase conductivity by several orders of magnitude and thus unmask the topological transition . \n we demonstrate that the reason for this intricate behavior lies in an important contrast between floquet bands in a time - dependent two - dimensional system and energy bands of a static one . \n specifically , the topological transitions in the former case are most naturally described by a @xmath3 dimensional theory @xcite , in which the extra ( time ) dimension is effectively compactified . \n the extra degree of freedom , present in the floquet system but absent in static leads , creates a mismatch between the two with sometimes dramatic consequences for transport . \n our theory also naturally explains why the phase diagram of topological states in such systems is , as we find , remarkably rich .        \n _ model and bulk topological transitions_.the geometry we consider is illustrated in fig .  \n [ fig : setup ] . \n circularly polarized light of frequency @xmath4 and electric field strength @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the speed of light , impinges on a large graphene sheet . \n the field is assumed to be uniform in the plane so that the electronic states may be characterized by a two - dimensional wavevector * k * of a band @xmath7 within the hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz ) . \n because the vector potential is periodic , the time - dependent schrdinger equation represents a floquet problem @xcite , for which wavefunctions @xmath8 , two - component spinors encoding the wavefunction amplitudes on each of the sublattices of the honeycomb lattice , can be represented in the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 a periodic function . \n this obeys the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional eigenvalue equation , @xmath11 with floquet hamiltonian of the form ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the hopping parameter , @xmath15 \\cdot { \\bf a}_n } $ ] is the nearest - neighbor tight - binding factor where @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , are the three nearest neighbor vectors of the honeycomb lattice for graphene ( lattice parameter @xmath18 nm ) and @xmath19 is the vector potential of a rotating electric field . the quasienergies @xmath20 can be chosen in the `` floquet zone '' ( fz ) @xmath21 by multiplying @xmath22 by @xmath23 with integer @xmath24 appropriately selected . \n while solutions related to one another in this way represent the same solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , they are _ different _ eigenstates of @xmath25 . \n the full vector space of these states is needed to allow matching of wavefunctions to external states , for example to a lead where current may be injected or removed . \n thus , to deal with such systems one must treat the time degree of freedom as a genuine extra dimension , compactified via the periodic ( temporal ) boundary condition on @xmath26 .    . \n the solid ( green , blue and magenta ) lines trace the evolution of the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 points . \n ( b ) bulk chern numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the total chern number @xmath32 vs. period . \n the shaded gray areas are the topological transitions where the numerical error in computing the chern numbers is large.,width=288 ]    fig .  \n [ fig : bulkt](a ) illustrates numerically generated values of @xmath33 associated with @xmath25 vs. period @xmath34 . \n several transitions are observed where quasienergy gaps close around zero or @xmath35 . \n the first topological transition for @xmath36 occurs when the gap at the fz boundary @xmath35 closes at the @xmath27 point ( @xmath37 ) . \n further topological transitions occur as @xmath38 increases , and may proceed in several ways , always involving a gap closing . in most cases \n the closings involve the formation of a dirac point either at zero quasienergy or at the fz boundary . \n these may occur at bz high - symmetry points , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , yielding , respectively one , two , or three distinct closing points . \n as explained in the next section , the gap closing at @xmath27 can sometimes be quadratic . \n we also observe gap closings away from high - symmetry points , in which case we observe six distinct dirac points at the transition .    \n these gap closings are accompanied by changes in the topology of the bulk band structure characterized by its chern numbers . \n the chern number @xmath39 of each floquet band is calculated by integrating its berry s curvature . \n because each dirac point induces an exchange of chern number @xmath40 between bands , and a quadratic touching induces an exchange of @xmath41 across the transition , all our transitions involve chern number changes of magnitude @xmath42 or 6  @xcite . \n bulk - boundary correspondence in a static system relates the chern number to the total number of edge states . \n however , in a floquet system , the two gap closings at zero quasienergy and at fz boundary are not equivalent : when edges are present in the system , changes in the number of edge states are induced around the quasienergy in which a gap closing occurs . \n this means there may be topologically distinguishable states with the same chern number . \n specifically , @xmath32 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are topological invariants that relate , respectively , to edge states traversing the gaps at zero quasienergy and the fz boundary  @xcite . \n our model allows numerical computation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , fully specifying the bulk topology and determining where edge states lie in the quasienergy spectrum  @xcite . \n this results in a particularly rich phase diagram for the system as its parameters are varied . \n fig .  \n [ fig : bulkt](b ) shows the associated chern numbers calculated numerically , clearly identifying the topological nature of the transitions . \n we have also explicitly checked that the edge state spectrum in a finite ribbon agrees with the chern numbers . \n our exploration of this phase diagram is detailed in the supplemental material  @xcite .    \n _ topological transitions in a floquet tight - binding system_.we next develop a framework to describe these topological transitions and their transport signatures , in a way that is generalizable to any tight - binding system . \n we begin with the floquet hamiltonian , which for the graphene system is given by eq .  \n ( [ hf ] ) . in general the quantity \n @xmath43 may be expanded in a fourier decomposition , @xmath44 . for concreteness \n we consider the transitions at the @xmath27 and @xmath28 points .    \n precisely at the @xmath27 point @xmath45 has a simple form : for any integer @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a bessel function , @xmath50 , and the upper ( lower ) sign applies for @xmath46 even ( odd ) . because @xmath51 only for @xmath46 divisible by 3 , the @xmath27 point has a remarkable property : at this point , @xmath25 has a period only 1/3 that of other @xmath52-points . \n this effect is an entwining of the temporal and spatial symmetries , and it allows different states with quasienergy @xmath53 to be degenerate for appropriately chosen parameters . when this occurs , the system is topologically critical , as we show below . to the lowest order in @xmath54 , we may keep only @xmath55 and @xmath56 becomes nearly time - independent . \n its eigenvalues are approximately given by @xmath57 , and the associated eigenvectors are just @xmath58 the first crossing is that of the @xmath59 level with the @xmath60 level at the fz boundary , followed by the crossing between @xmath61 and @xmath62 at zero quasienergy .    at the @xmath28 point , an analogous calculation yields @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath46 even ( odd ) . \n the largest contribution now comes from @xmath65 and the eigenvalues are approximately @xmath66 ^ 2}$ ] . \n the eigenvectors have a form @xmath67 with time - independent @xmath68 and @xmath69 . \n the first transition appears at the fz boundary between @xmath62 and @xmath61 at @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath60 at @xmath72 . \n fig .  \n [ fig : theory ] illustrates the eigenvalues as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath73 . \n the periods agree well with critical values we find numerically [ fig .  \n [ fig : bulkt](a ) ] .    \n to infer the order of a transition , we project the full floquet hamiltonian into a two - dimensional space for each value of @xmath74 in the vicinity of the bz point where the transition occurs using the states of the form @xmath75 , in precise analogy with @xmath76 perturbation theory . at the @xmath27 point near the transition at zero quasienergy , the @xmath77 states are degenerate and their eigenvectors are used to construct basis states in the vicinity of the @xmath27 point . \n the resulting projected hamiltonian is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath81 around @xmath82 , in good agreement with our numerics . \n one may perform the same kind of analysis near the first transition at the fz boundary . to second order in @xmath74 , this produces the projected hamiltonian @xmath83 , with @xmath84 . \n ( see supplemental material for details  @xcite . ) \n one may easily confirm that there is a @xmath85 exchange between the two bands that diagonalize this hamiltonian when @xmath86 . \n this is precisely the change we observe in our numerics .     \n ( green ) and @xmath28 ( blue ) points obtained from the lowest perturbation theory . \n the fourier index @xmath46 is shown . \n circles mark the avoided crossings between branches where @xmath46 differs by @xmath87 . \n , width=288 ]    of course , not all the gap closings occur at the @xmath27 and @xmath28 points . in principle \n the method we have developed can be employed to describe the region around a gap closing in terms of just two ( time - dependent ) states , from which the order of the transition and its fourier structure can be inferred . \n furthermore , there is nothing fundamental about our approach limiting it to graphene : it can be employed for general systems in which floquet band - gap closings occur .    \n _ transport properties and disorder_.as discussed above , bands of different @xmath46 values , representing different temporal subbands of the @xmath3-dimensional problem , get woven into the quasienergy bands in the fz as topological transitions occur . \n the resulting states have a complicated time dependence , sometimes allowing only very weak couplings to states governed by a static hamiltonian ( for example , those of a time - independent lead ) , since the latter have much simpler time dependence . in such cases , at a transition  where one expects conductivity of order @xmath0 in a two - terminal geometry  @xcite when the fermi energy is at a dirac point  the conductivity will be suppressed . moreover , as we show below , disorder can spoil the entwining of spatial and temporal symmetries that causes this suppression .     \n point ( solid lines ) and @xmath28 point ( dashed green line ) transitions at , respectively , @xmath88 and @xmath89 when @xmath73 . \n three different situations are shown for the @xmath27 point : a clean system ( black ) , a partially disordered one ( red ) where on - site disorder is present only over a length 9@xmath90 in the contact region ( see inset ) , and one in which there is disorder throughout the ribbon ( blue ) . \n the disorder strength in both cases is 0.15@xmath14 . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    an example of these phenomena is illustrated in fig .  \n [ fig : transport ] , where we present differential conductance results in the system with periodic boundary conditions along its width as a function of length @xmath91 for @xmath73  . \n details of the calculation scheme are discussed in the supplemental material  @xcite . in the clean system , \n the transition at the @xmath27 point for @xmath92 presents a conductance that drops precipitously with @xmath91similar to what one would expect if the spectrum were gapped  before leveling off at @xmath93 , yielding behavior roughly like that of a very poor metal . \n by contrast , the differential conductance at the @xmath28 point transition for @xmath89 has a scale and @xmath91 dependence similar to that of a static system .    \n the surprising behavior of the @xmath92 transition reflects the 2 + 1 dimensional nature of the floquet system . as illustrated in fig .  \n [ fig : theory ] , the transition involves a degeneracy at zero quasienergy at the @xmath27 point for temporal subbands @xmath59 , so that these states have time dependence @xmath94 . small corrections to this exist at high order in @xmath54 , but the symmetry of the @xmath27 point allows only subbands with time dependence @xmath95 to enter the exact eigenstate of @xmath25 . \n by contrast , states in the lead at the fermi energy @xmath96 have _ no _ time dependence . \n since wavefunctions must match at a junction between a lead and the `` scattering '' region in both space and time , only the temporal @xmath60 state at the @xmath27 point matches onto the relevant lead state . because this does not occur at zero quasienergy , the corresponding state is evanescent , leading to the dramatic falloff with @xmath91 . \n away from the @xmath27 point , symmetry does allow some admixture of an @xmath60 temporal state , and a corresponding differential conductance that falls off approximately as a power law with @xmath91 rather than exponentially . \n since this coupling vanishes precisely where the gap vanishes , the net result is an anomalously small conductance at large @xmath91 . \n by contrast , gap closings where a time - independent subband participates yield far larger conductances . \n the first @xmath28 point transition at @xmath89 provides an example of this , in agreement with our numerical results in fig .  \n [ fig : transport ] .    \n a remarkable consequence of this structure is that the differential conductance may be greatly _ enhanced _ by disorder , which spoils the entwined spatial - temporal symmetry at the @xmath27 point , and allows the @xmath60 subband to be admixed into states with quasienergy near zero . as illustrated in fig .  \n [ fig : transport ] for the @xmath92 transition , this is particularly effective when disorder is concentrated near the junction to the lead ( see inset ) . \n disorder throughout the ribbon yields very similar behavior at small @xmath91 , but suppresses the conductance at large @xmath91 , a phenomenon we associate with localization of the wavefunctions .    _ \n discussion_.in this study we have focused on results for ribbons with periodic boundary conditions along their width in order to understand bulk transport . \n the system with open boundary conditions also supports edge states whose structure depends on the topological indices of the state . \n our numerics confirms this behavior , as well as their contribution to transport . \n it should be noted however that in the infinite width limit , edge state transport is always negligible compared to bulk transport for metallic states in a ribbon geometry . \n away from a transition point , multi -

site correlated hopping term is not important in determining the ground state properties . for more insights \n , we have also calculated the elementary excitations , i.e. , the energy gaps to the excited states of the system . in the strong rung limit \n , we found that the doped hole behaves as a bloch quasiparticle in both systems where the spin and charge of the doped hole are tightly bound together . in the isotropic limit , while the hole still behaves like a quasiparticle in the long - wavelength limit , its spin and charge components are only loosely bound together with a nontrivial mutual statistics inside the quasiparticle . \n our results show that this mutual statistics can lead to an important residual effect which dramatically changes the local structure of the ground state wavefunction .    \n it is believed that a minimal model which captures the strong - correlation physics of high - temperature superconductivity is the hubbard model and its strong - coupling limit , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . \n of fundamental importance is the question of whether these simple models contain the basic requirements to support superconductivity in the phase diagram as compared to other phases.@xcite however , despite decades of studies , the precise nature of these simple models are still not well understood in two dimensions ( 2d ) , including the ground state properties . \n alternatively , ladder systems serve as a bridge from one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains to 2d systems , offering a rich playground for studying the interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom and providing a pathway to understand the physics of strongly correlated systems . \n specifically , the motion of single hole doped into the two - leg ladder antiferromagnet is a fundamental issue to start with , where the key physics of the problem is the competition between the antiferromagnetic correlation and the kinetic energy of the hole .    \n theoretically , it has long been thought that the undoped two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder is adiabatically related to a band insulator , and earlier numerical studies supported the idea that the doped holes form conventional bloch quasiparticles.@xcite quite strikingly , recent large - scale density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies provide strong evidences to show that a single hole doped to the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder localizes at large length scales , breaking the translational symmetry , which is sharply incompatible with bloch s theorem for any quasiparticle state@xcite . a more recent dmrg study of the same model however reached an opposite conclusion where the hole behaves as a conventional quasiparticle with finite quasiparticle spectral weight , and there is no charge localization@xcite . as a result , this seemingly simple problem is still in debate , requiring further independent investigation .    besides the @xmath0-@xmath1 model \n , it is also important to study the hubbard model directly to investigate the properties of a single doped hole . \n this is due to three - site correlated hopping terms discarded in traditional @xmath0-@xmath1 model studies for simplicity . \n indeed , this three - site correlated hopping term was shown to be crucial to understand the origin of the strongly dispersive feature found at high binding energy in the spectral function of the hubbard model@xcite , as well as contributing to the persistence of spin excitations with hole doping and hardening of spin excitations with electron doping in the hubbard model@xcite . \n a natural question is that whether these three - site correlated hopping terms still play an important role in the ground state properties of the single hole .    \n -@xmath1 model on a two - leg square ladder . here \n @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) describe the inter -

leg hubbard ladder behaves similarly with the @xmath0-@xmath1 model as shown in the phase diagram in fig . \n [ fig : hubbardphase ] . in the strong rung limit ( @xmath9 ) \n , the injected hole behaves as a bloch quasiparticle and there is no charge modulation in the hole density profile . \n as the ladder anisotropic parameter is continuously tuned from the strong rung limit beyond a critical value @xmath10 towards the isotropic limit ( @xmath6 ) , a strong charge modulation appears in the hole density distribution . \n therefore , we conclude that the three - site correlated hopping term is not crucial in determining the ground state properties of the single doped hole . \n ( 2 ) we found that the elementary excitation energy of the single doped hole in two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder scales as @xmath11 in both limits , including the strong - rung limit @xmath9 and isotropic case @xmath6 , supporting the quasiparticle behavior of the doped hole . as the single hole doped in both models has similar behavior , our conclusion for the @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder should also apply for the hubbard ladder , i.e. , the injected hole also behave as a quasiparticle in the isotropic limit . \n ( 3 ) although in the long - wavelength limit , the single doped hole behaves similarly in both the strong rung limit ( @xmath9 ) and isotropic case ( @xmath6 ) , there is a significant difference between them . \n the spin and charge of the hole are tightly bound together as a quasiparticle at a length scale @xmath12 lattice spacing in the strong - rung limit , however , they are only loosely bound together at a longer length scale @xmath13 lattice spacings in the isotropic case . \n this loose quasiparticle has a nontrivial internal structure since the spin partner can now move away from the charge partner , leading to an important residual effect which significantly changes the local structure of the ground state wavefunction .    in section [ sec : model ] , we define the model hamiltonians of the two -

\n essentially this asks that if the behaviour of wave speed for an electromagnetic medium is known , what can we say about the medium ? \n these questions are of theoretical interest , but also of practical interest as they relate to understanding measured data in engineering applications like traveltime tomography in anisotropic medium . \n we will here only study the problem at a point @xmath7 since the dependence will never be unique . \n for example , the fresnel surface @xmath5 is always invariant under scalings and inversions of @xmath1 @xcite . in general , these are not the only invariances , and for a general @xmath1 the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 does not seem to be very well understood .    a natural first task is to characterise those mediums @xmath1 for which the fresnel surface @xmath5 is the light cone of a lorentz metric @xmath9 . \n this question was raised in @xcite . \n a partial solution was given in @xcite , and ( in skewon - free mediums with real coefficients ) the complete solution was given in @xcite . \n the result is that if the fresnel surface is a light cone , then @xmath1 is necessarily proportional to a hodge star operator ( plus , possibly , an axion component proportional to the identity ) . for an alternative proof , \n see @xcite , and for related results , see @xcite .    \n the main contribution of this paper is theorem [ thm : factormedium ] . \n it gives a pointwise characterisation of all electromagnetic medium tensors @xmath1 with real coefficients such that    1 .   \n @xmath1 is invertible , 2 .   \n @xmath1 is skewon - free , 3 .   \n @xmath1 is _ birefringent _ , that is , the fresnel surface of @xmath1 is the union of two distinct light cones for lorentz metrics .    \n the first two assumptions imply that @xmath1 is essentially in one - to - one correspondence with an _ \n area metric_. area metrics also appear when studying the propagation of a photon in a vacuum with a first order correction from quantum electrodynamics @xcite . \n the einstein field equations have also been generalised into equations where the unknown field is an area metric @xcite . for further examples , \n see @xcite and for the differential geometry of area metrics , see @xcite . for maxwell \n s equations , the interpretation of condition _ ( iii ) _ is that differently polarised waves can propagate with different wave speeds . in such medium \n one should expect that propagation of electromagnetic waves is determined by null - geodesics of two lorentz metrics . \n a typical example of such medium is a uniaxial crystal for partial results describing when the fresnel surface factorises , see @xcite and in 3 dimensions , see @xcite .    in theorem [ thm : factormedium ] \n we show that there are only three medium classes with the above properties and we give explicit expressions in local coordinates for each class . of these classes , the first is a generalisation of uniaxial medium and the last seems to be unphysical ; heuristic arguments suggest that maxwell s equations are not hyperbolic in the last class . \n the main idea of the proof is as follows . \n we will use the normal form theorem for area metrics derived in @xcite , which pointwise divides area metrics into @xmath10 metaclasses and gives explicit expressions in local coordinates for each metaclass . this result was also used in @xcite , and by @xcite we only need to consider the first 7 metaclasses . for each of these metaclasses , \n the fresnel surface can be written as @xmath11 for a homogeneous @xmath2th order polynomial @xmath12 with coefficients determined by @xmath8 . since @xmath8 is birefringent \n , @xmath13 factorises as @xmath14 into homogeneous @xmath15nd order polynomials @xmath16 . by identifying coefficients \n we obtain a system of polynomial equations in coefficients of @xmath13 and @xmath17 . in the last step \n we eliminate the coefficients in @xmath17 from these equations whence we obtain constraints on @xmath13 ( and hence on @xmath1 ) that much be satisfied when @xmath1 is birefringent . to eliminate variables we use the technique of _ grbner bases _ , which was also used in @xcite .    \n a limitation of theorem [ thm : factormedium ] is that the explicit expression is only valid at a point . \n the reason for this is that the decomposition in @xcite essentially relies on the jordan normal form theorem for matrices , which is unstable under perturbations . \n another limitation is that we do not allow for complex coefficients in @xmath1 \n . therefore mediums like _ chiral medium _ are not included in the mediums in theorem [ thm : factormedium ] .    \n this paper relies on computations by computer algebra . for information about the mathematica notebooks for these computations , \n please see the author s homepage .

dependent @xmath71  @xcite . \n these coefficients reflect the increase in kinetic inductance of the superconducting nanowire due to the cooper - pair breaking effect of the external magnetic field , and are related to the thermodynamic critical field of the superconductor : @xmath72  @xcite . the penetration depth in the films @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the london penetration depth , is much greater than @xmath75 . \n therefore , for @xmath76 , a meissner state can not be induced in the resonators and only a small fraction of the applied field is expelled . in this case , the thermodynamic critical field is modified as @xmath77  @xcite , which leads to @xmath78  [ fig .  \n 4(c ) ] . \n furthermore , extending this geometrical scaling to the case of a parallel field yields an effective thickness of the superconductor @xmath79 . \n the reduced effective thickness of the film in the context of magnetic field expulsion is likely a combined effect of surface oxidation and the suppression of shielding currents within a coherence length from the edge .    in summary , \n microwave resonators based on nbtin nanowires with extremely small cross section are highly insensitive to parallel magnetic field , with @xmath21 remaining unaffected up to @xmath19 . because of the high kinetic inductance of the nanowires , \n the resonators are expected to produce an order of magnitude higher vacuum voltage fluctuations compared to standard cpw resonators . \n next experiments will focus on achieving strong coupling between these nanowire resonators and spin qubits in gate -

axis \n .    the scalars @xmath141 and @xmath142 satisfy the relations @xmath143 @xmath144 from which it follows that @xmath145 @xmath146 with @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the radial part of @xmath149 and @xmath150 is the spherical bessel function of @xmath151 . in eqs . \n @xmath152 @xmath153 .    \n thus the initial cumbersome task of handling the expectation value @xmath154 is reduced to calculation of the simple overlap integrals .    \n all these formulae can be useful when studying cm corrections of the cross sections of the elastic and quasifree electron scattering from nuclei more complicated than the @xmath155 nucleus . \n an attractive feature of similar studies is to proceed with one and the same corrected many - body wf of the nuclear g.s . in evaluating different structure functions like the dd and md . \n of certain interest might be deviations of the @xmath156-dependence of the ratio @xmath157 beyond the ho model from that which is given by the canonical tassie -

ray diffraction data on the same piece of lsco @xmath7 . \n we show that the fluctuating sdw amplitude of the frequency where it is the strongest , decreases at a temperature equal to @xmath13 within experimental error . \n in addition , we could not find any indications for cdw in our sample . \n we argue that these findings explain the previously measured @xmath14  k discrepancy between the sdw freezing and the opening of a ng , and tie the latter to fluctuating sdw .    \n the neutron experiment was performed at rita -

resolved bottom part of an hourglass . \n this will be demonstrated subsequently . \n the scattering intensity is stronger at elevated temperatures . \n interestingly , at @xmath18  k spectral weight is missing at low energies , suggesting the presence of a soft gap for spin excitations . \n a similar spectrum , including the gap , was observed at the fully developed hourglass dispersion of la@xmath29ba@xmath30cuo@xmath2  @xcite , la@xmath31sr@xmath32cuo@xmath2  @xcite , and la@xmath33sr@xmath34coo@xmath2  @xcite .    \n q -

orbit interactions ( rdi ) has been studied in a few publications ( cf.@xcite ) . it was found by schliemann _ \n et al _ @xcite that at zero magnetic field in 2d semiconductor nanostructures for equal strengths of the rdi there is an additional symmetry @xcite . as a consequence , the orbital motion is decoupled from the spin evolution . \n if this resonant condition is not active , the spin dynamics is influenced by the different spin relaxation mechanisms related to orbital scattering processes . in this paper \n we discuss another spin symmetry that arises at certain conditions at nonzero magnetic field in the plane and arbitrary strengths of the spin - orbit terms in a quantum wire . in virtue of this symmetry \n the spin - flip rotation is suppressed at arbitrary polarization of the injected electrons . by setting these conditions on and off , \n the flow of a certain spin polarization through the device is either allowed or destroyed , thus , defining a transistor - like action for the spin .    \n we consider the conduction band of a 2d semiconductor quantum well within the effective mass approximation . \n the wire geometry is defined by a transversal potential @xmath0 : @xmath1 . \n the dresselhaus interaction has , in general , a cubic dependence on the momentum of the carriers . for a narrow \n @xmath2 $ ] quantum well , it reduces to the 2d linear momentum dependent term @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the interaction strength ) . in the asymmetric quantum wells the bychkov - rashba interaction has the form : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the corresponding strength . \n our system hamiltonian reads as @xmath7 where we include the effect of the in - plane magnetic field by means of the zeeman interaction @xmath8 . here \n , @xmath9 represents the in - plane orientation of the magnetic field with the intensity @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the effective gyromagnetic factor and @xmath12 is the bohr s magneton . \n note that none of the interactions break the translational invariance in the longitudinal coordinate . \n therefore , the eigenstates are chosen to have a well - defined longitudinal momentum @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 stand for transversal , longitudinal and spin quantum numbers . as a result , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is transformed to the effective one for the transversal coordinate for a given value of @xmath16 @xmath18.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] two different spin - dependent terms can be distinguished within this hamiltonian ; one is involving the transversal component of the momentum and the other contains the effective zeeman - like term including contributions from the rdi . \n if both terms are parallel in the spin space , a symmetry arises and the spin is totally decoupled from the orbital motion . in order to set this symmetry , it is required to fulfill the following condition @xmath19= \\sin\\theta+\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\cos\\theta.\\ ] ] once eq.([condition ] ) is fulfilled , the spin operator @xmath20 commutes with the resulting hamiltonian @xmath21\\left(\\alpha\\sigma_x-\\beta\\sigma_y\\right),\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath22=0 $ ] . \n consequently , the spin symmetry is set up for transversal eigenstates having longitudinal momentum @xmath23 . \n according to eq.([condition ] ) , this can be done by tuning a proper intensity @xmath24 and an orientation of the applied in - plane magnetic field for given strengths @xmath6 and @xmath4 . \n it is noteworthy that this property is valid for any transversal potential defining the wire geometry , since the symmetry arises from the relation between the rdi and the zeeman interaction in conjunction with the longitudinal translational invariance . \n in addition , there is an extra degree of freedom , since the rdi strengths ( for example , @xmath6 ) can be modified as well in order to fulfill the condition .    in virtue of the spin symmetry , \n the spinorial part of the eigenstates can be expressed as @xmath25 where thereafter @xmath26 . these eigenspinors correspond to the in - plane orientation of the spin , where the particular orientation is determined by the ratio between the strengths of the both spin - orbit mechanisms . \n note that in the hamiltonian the spin - dependent term , linear in the transversal momentum @xmath27 , can be eliminated by redefining the origin of the transversal momentum for each spin state . \n the only effect of this term on the energy spectrum is a constant shift that may be neglected by changing the energy origin .    at the condition ( [ condition ] ) \n hold fixed , the spectrum of the system is composed of that corresponding to the spin - independent orbital motion @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , the constant shift and a contribution arising from a combination of the rdi strengths and the zeeman interaction @xmath30 here we introduced the absolute magnitude of the rdi strength vector @xmath31 . \n the above contribution represents a constant spin splitting for the eigenstates and its value depends on the longitudinal momentum , the rdi strengths , the particular orientation and the intensity of the applied magnetic field . at the preserved symmetry the eigenstates ( [ psi ] ) take the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenstates of @xmath34 . \n we have also defined the length @xmath35 giving the characteristic scale for the rdi strengths .    at given fermi energy @xmath36 eigenstates \n have a few real longitudinal momentum @xmath16 . \n some of them have @xmath37 ( propagating right ) , while the others have @xmath38 ( propagating left ) . \n one of those @xmath16 could satisfy the condition by the adjusted magnetic field and , consequently , the corresponding spinor does not depend on coordinates . however , even a small mixing between the selected state and those that propagate in the same direction but have different @xmath16 leads to the spin precession in the process of the propagation . to suppress unwanted @xmath16-values \n one can adjust the fermi energy ( or the potential @xmath0 ) to have only four real longitudinal momenta . \n next , the tuning of the intensity and the orientation of the magnetic field enables us to have two eigenstates ( with @xmath39 in eq.([spectrum ] ) ) , propagating in the same direction , with the same energy and @xmath40 . from eqs.([condition ] ) , ( [ spectrum ] ) one obtains that such a possibility can be realized , if the components of the magnetic field are proportional to the components of the rdi vector : @xmath41 as a result , there is no a spin - flip process for any superposition of these eigenstates . \n note that , in contrast to the spin - field transistor proposed in ref.@xcite whose effect is based on a particular input spin polarization , in our case the spin - flip is absent for an arbitrary input spin polarization . \n also , the magnetic field leads to a nonequivalence of the electron transport from the left to the right and vise versa : eq . \n is fulfilled for @xmath42 at the condition @xmath43 .    to illuminate the found effect in the electron transport \n we perform numerical calculations of the @xmath44-matrix in the tight - binding model ( cf @xcite ) . \n to proceed we use a square lattice @xmath45 \n ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 are vectors of a length @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , respectively ; @xmath48 is the lattice constant , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are integers ) . within this approach \n our hamiltonian has the following form @xmath53 here @xmath54 creates an electron at site n with spin @xmath55 and energy @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 stands for nearest neighbors sites @xmath15 and @xmath59 . for the sake of illustration , we choose for the wire potential a hard wall one : @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 otherwise .    \n let us consider the system with a geometry shown in fig.[fig1 ] . \n it consists of a finite scattering area with two lateral contacts . \n each contact is a narrow stripe with the width @xmath63 and , for simplicity , no spin - orbit couplings and no the magnetic field . \n the contacts are gated to have two active channels ( spin up and down ) with a conductance @xmath64 in each . \n thus , the rdi and the in - plane magnetic field present only in the scattering area of the length @xmath65 and the width @xmath66 . \n the experiment may consist of injecting a current @xmath67 through the left contact ( source ) to the wire and measuring the voltage drop @xmath68 generated in the right contact ( drain ) . according to the landauer - buttiker formalism for linear response ( cf @xcite ) , the ratio @xmath69 can be expressed by dint of the @xmath44-matrix elements @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denote the channels in the source ( the drain ) . in our approach \n the spin resolved conductance between the source and the drain is determined as @xmath72 \\sum_{nm}|s_{m\\sigma_2 n\\sigma_1}|^2 $ ] , where @xmath73 $ ] . \n the conductance is calculated with the energy dependent @xmath44-matrix by direct solving the schrdinger equation in a discretized space according to the method suggested in ref.@xcite .    \n note that the interfaces ( the polarizers ) between areas with and without the rdi introduce some uncontrollable excitations of all modes inside the scattering area . \n in particular , these excitations produce a superposition ( with coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) of two eigenfunctions @xmath76 with different longitudinal momenta and , therefore , rotate the spin during a transport along the @xmath49-axis . \n indeed , one has the following expectation values @xmath77 where @xmath78 . \n evidently , for equal longitudinal momenta , the expectation values are independent on the @xmath49 coordinate . \n the results ( see fig.[fig2 ] , top ) manifest a single common minimum of the spin - flip conductance @xmath79 for one value of the magnetic field orientation but for different sample lengths , at a given intensity of the magnetic field and at zero temperature . at this value eq . \n holds , indeed . for another angles \n there is the mixing of wavefunctions with different @xmath16 which leads to the electron spin rotation in the sample . \n fig.[fig3 ] illuminates the dependence of longitudinal momenta @xmath80 on the magnetic field orientation . at a particular value of the angle @xmath81 two wavenumbers \n coincide . \n however , the change of the magnetic field intensity ( the value of @xmath82 ) leads to avoided crossing of two curves @xmath80 .    in real experiments the injected beam consists of electrons with different energies due to , for example , a nonzero temperature \n the temperature induces a small mixture of spin - flip components and results in the increase of the spin - flip conductance ( see fig.[fig2 ] , bottom ) . \n however , it does not affect the angle value at which the minima occur simultaneously in the two samples at temperature @xmath83 k.    measurements of the rdi strengths is a subject of intensive experimental efforts @xcite . \n for example , the ratio @xmath84 could determined with the aid of the analysis of photocurrents @xcite . note that eq . \n enables us to determine the strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus interactions . \n we propose to use a wire with a length determined by the condition @xmath85 . \n according to our analysis ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , such a system produces a few , well resolved spin - flip conductance minima . \n this condition helps also to diminish the effect of evanescent modes . \n the fermi energy and the transversal potential @xmath0 should be taken to support only four propagating modes ( two with a positive @xmath16 , going to the right and two with a negative @xmath16 , going to the left ) . \n the measure of the spin - flip conductance provides a set of spin - flip minima at different intensities and different orientations of the magnetic field , at a fixed input polarization . taking another polarization and repeating the same measurement , \n one obtains a different pattern for the location of the minima . as an example \n , we calculate the spin - flip conductance for two input polarizations  \n along @xmath49- and @xmath50- axis ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) . \n one obtains the required minimum which is subject to eq . at the same angle and the same intensity in different setups , since the effect is independent on the polarization . \n one might repeat measurements for different sample lengths , since the minimum position is independent on the length too . to diminish the effect of multiple reflection from the polarizers we suggest to use the same polarization direction in the both polarizers .    in conclusion \n , we found the condition ( eq.([condition ] ) ) to decouple the spin and the orbital motion of electrons in a quantum wire with the in - plane magnetic field and arbitrary rashba and dresselhaus strengths . at this condition \n there is the spin symmetry in an arbitrary transversal potential defining the wire geometry . \n furthermore , at the specific condition ( [ mf ] ) the magnetic field cancels the rdi for the electron momentum @xmath40 . as a result , during the electron transport through the wire \n the spin - flip rotation is absent for any chosen polarization . \n we propose the experiment to measure the strengths of the rashba and the dresselhaus interaction by finding the minimum of the spin - flip conductance , which should occur at the condition ( [ mf ] ) .

and - sawtooth - lattices ] ] zigzag and sawtooth lattices + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to achieve a sawtooth lattice with a nearly flat band , we begin by considering an alternative lattice structure which is easier to obtain , a zigzag lattice . in our optical potential ( eq . \n ( [ pot ] ) ) , if we set @xmath38 , then a zigzag lattice is at hand . \n the zigzag lattice has the two lowest energy @xmath39-orbital bands corresponding to two basis lattice sites , labeled by @xmath36 and @xmath29 , within the unit cell ( see fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) . \n the inter - unit - cell tunnelling between neighbouring a ( or b ) wells is defined as @xmath0 ( or @xmath30 ) , and the intra - unit - cell tunnelling between a and b is @xmath1 . \n we employ a large potential depth of the lw lattice @xmath40 to isolate a one - dimensional array in vertical direction , and therefore the coupling between adjacent one - dimensional zigzag lattices is negligible . with symmetric zigzag lattice configuration \n , we have @xmath41 . in this case , the band structure is determined by inter- ( @xmath0 , @xmath30 ) and intra- ( @xmath1 ) unit - cell tunnelling energies as shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( a ) for variable tunnelling ratio @xmath42 .    to search for \n a flat band in the sawtooth lattice , let us first consider the particular ratio of @xmath42 required to support a flat band in a tight - binding model . \n a sawtooth lattice with a flat band will be obtained if we make @xmath43 , and the relation @xmath34 is satisfied  @xcite . \n these two conditions can be achieved by varying the parameters of the optical potential such as @xmath44 . to achieve the first condition of @xmath43 \n , we introduce the square lattice of the potential depth @xmath6 as described below , and then we vary the ratio between @xmath26 and @xmath23 to satisfy the second requirement of @xmath45 in the sawtooth lattice .    \n here we first demonstrate the way to fully control the tunnelling ratio @xmath42 in the zigzag case before we discuss the transform of the lattice into the sawtooth configuration . as it is difficult to obtain an obvious relation connecting the potential parameters @xmath26 and @xmath23 with the tunnelling energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we first calculate the bloch state of the two - dimensional superlattice using the plane - wave expansion method with variable lattice settings  @xcite . \n then , we perform least - square fitting of the band structure along the y - direction by the one - dimensional tight binding model of the zigzag lattice . \n the hamiltonian for the zigzag lattice in the second quantised form is given : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the annihilation operator at the site @xmath48 in the @xmath49-th unit cell . \n then in the momentum - space basis @xmath50 , the hamiltonian is diagonalised giving the tight - binding matrix @xmath51 of the zigzag lattice . @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the lowest eigen - energy of the quantum well @xmath36,@xmath29 and @xmath54 the lattice constant .    \n since @xmath31 and @xmath41 are naturally satisfied in the zigzag lattice we consider here , the tight binding dispersion for a zigzag lattice is then simplified to : @xmath55    this dispersion is quite sensitive to the ratio @xmath42 as shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) . therefore fitting the band structure obtained by the plane - wave expansion method with the eq.([eq4 ] ) \n , we obtain the ratio of @xmath42 from the potential parameters @xmath26 and @xmath23 as shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ( b ) . to fulfil the condition @xmath56 , the ratio of @xmath57 should be extremely high around the order for about @xmath58100 . in this case , \n the hopping integrals are quite sensitive to the overlap between wannier functions . \n indeed , they are exponentially dependent on space coordinates , and therefore the hopping elements are very sensitive to the separation between the associated potential wells . for current form of the potential \n well , the separation between two neighbouring @xmath36 wells that is about @xmath59 times larger than the separation between neighbouring @xmath36 and @xmath29 wells , and therefore it will generate an extremely large @xmath42 ratio . to reduce this ratio down to @xmath60 \n , we have to modify the shape of the potential wells reducing @xmath1 and enhancing @xmath0 . \n so it s necessary to increase @xmath57 ratio , making the potential wells longer and narrower . \n this method reduces the overlap between a and b wells , but enhances the overlap between neighbouring a wells explaining the reason for such a large value of @xmath57 .     between the bandwidths for the ground and the first excited band \n is calculated for variable lattice depths @xmath26 , @xmath23 and @xmath6 \n . in the diagram , the solid curve represents the lattice setting ( @xmath61 ) in which the flatness ratio @xmath62 is larger than 50 . the maximum flatness @xmath62 decrease as a function of the lattice depth @xmath26 as indicated by the colour scale . for each value of @xmath26 \n , the bar around the date point indicates the characteristic range of ( @xmath63 ) in which the flatness @xmath62 is larger than 50 . \n the solid and dashed lines are guides to the eye.,width=364 ]    [ [ a -

dimensional square lattice potential with the depth of @xmath6 . \n the potential maximum ( minimum ) of the @xmath6 lattice is aligned to the middle point of neighbouring @xmath29 ( @xmath36 ) wells as described in fig .  \n [ fig2 ] ( c ) . \n then , the square lattice with the depth @xmath6 will generate an additional barrier between neighbouring b wells reducing @xmath30 significantly . \n because the barrier between neighbouring @xmath36 wells are reduced by @xmath6 , and therefore the @xmath64 should get modified to take this effect into account . from our analysis , making @xmath65 ( in the zigzag lattice ) is necessary to balance the effect of @xmath6 .     is increased . at the lattice setting of @xmath66 , \n the energies of the lowest two bands are calculated for @xmath67@xmath68 ( left to right ) . \n ( b ) in this setting , the first excited band becomes flattened with bandwidths from @xmath6950  hz to @xmath690.2  hz where the maximum flatness @xmath62 is @xmath58300 . here \n the bandwidth is calculated for ytterbium atoms as an example . \n ( c ) the real space optical potential and its corresponding momentum distribution are shown . \n the momentum distribution is calculated from the fourier transform of the single - particle ground state in the real space . in the momentum distribution , \n the area of the black dot reflects the fractional population at the reciprocal site and the * g * and * a * denote the reciprocal and the lattice vectors of the one - dimensional zigzag lattice respectively.,width=5 ]    indeed we investigate the dependance of the flatness of the first excited band on the lattice setting @xmath70 . to measure the flatness of the first excited band , \n we define the ratio between the bandwidths of the ground and the first excited band as @xmath62 , and numerically calculate @xmath62 as a function of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath6 as shown in fig .  \n [ fig3 ] . since the ratio @xmath57 must be large to obtain @xmath60 in the sawtooth lattice , we scan the potential depth @xmath23 around @xmath73 setting the potential depth @xmath26 from 28@xmath74 to 46@xmath74 \n . as @xmath26 decreases , the ratio @xmath42 increases ( see fig .  \n [ fig2 ] ( b ) ) . \n therefore , the relatively deep square lattice potential of @xmath6 is required to keep the small value of @xmath42 for achieving a nearly flat band . from our numerical analysis \n , we find the flatness of r@xmath7550 can be easily achieved for a wide range of the lattice setting . in fig .  \n [ fig3 ] , we provide a set of parameters @xmath70 where the flatness @xmath62 is at least over 50 from @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for a real flat band in a sawtooth lattice , however , it s necessary to set the tunnelling @xmath30 to be exactly zero . \n this requires the barrier between neighbouring @xmath29 sites to be as large as possible , and therefore we should increase @xmath6 . \n however the increase of @xmath6 also has consequence in reducing the barrier between neighbouring @xmath36 sites . \n so with the presence of the square lattice , @xmath36 and @xmath29 potential wells are no longer identical to each other . this will give rise to slight difference in eigenvalues of the two potential wells @xmath78 and @xmath79 causing that the first excited band becomes dispersive ( see eq.([tbeq ] ) ) . \n therefore the presence of the square lattice with @xmath6 suppresses the tunnelling @xmath30 but introduces the finite dispersion of the first excited band at the same time . \n those limitations are prominent at the small value of @xmath80 in fig .  \n [ fig3 ] , and thus the bandwidth ratio between the ground and the first excited bands has a maximum value of @xmath81400 . for a larger value of @xmath82 , \n the first excited band become flattened at the small value of @xmath6 . in this case \n , the tunnelling @xmath30 can not be completely suppressed causing a small dispersion ( or @xmath83 ) of the band . \n this limitation can be readily solved by employing the lattice shaking technique which allows us to control the tunnelling @xmath0 and @xmath1 independently  @xcite . \n finally we demonstrate how the dispersive band in the zigzag lattice is adiabatically changed into a nearly flat band in the sawtooth lattice . as an example in fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) , the two lowest energy bands are shown as @xmath6 increases with the lattice setting of @xmath84 . \n the first excited band becomes flatter as the lattice geometry is changed from the zigzag to the sawtooth limit . \n indeed , the bandwidth of the first excited band becomes @xmath851  hz in this sawtooth limit where @xmath86 is the planck constant . \n considering a typical energy scale of on - site interaction energy at the intermediate lattice depth , a nearly flat band realised in this setting should reveal the effect of flat band associated with interactions . \n in addition , geometry of the undergoing lattice structure can be easily confirmed in an experiment with a bosonic superfluid occupying the ground state of the lattice potential . in fig .  \n [ fig4 ] ( c ) , the expected momentum distribution of bosonic atoms is shown for zigzag and sawtooth lattices , which is obtained from the calculation of the single - particle ground state .    in optical lattices , \n a flat band often emerges in either the second or third lowest energy band for sawtooth ( or lieb ) and kagome lattices respectively . in general \n , one may shake the optical lattice to flip the sign of the tunnelling energy by which atoms can be directly loaded in the flat band  @xcite . for bosons , \n atoms can be coherently transferred at the particular quasi - momentum ( say @xmath87=0 point ) by manipulating the energy level of the sub - lattice site  @xcite . \n the bosonic atoms in the flat band may decay into the lowest band as observed in the lieb lattice  @xcite , but the lifetime of atoms in the flat band can be lengthened by increasing the band gap  @xcite . the effect of the flat band for fermions , however , should be observable with minimal decay into the lowest band when the fermi energy is controlled near the energy of the flat band .    in this work , we provide a recipe to realise a one - dimensional sawtooth optical lattice with ultracold atoms . \n the highly tunable superlattice proposed here would offer a flexible experimental platform for the study of a flat band which is attainable in the sawtooth geometry . by simply adjusting lattice parameters and \n therefore controlling intra- and inter - unit - cell tunnelling , the first excited band becomes flat up to 2@xmath2 of the ground bandwidth for a wide range of the lattice setting . \n our superlattice yields the zigzag and sawtooth lattices for alkali - earth - like bosons and fermions ( e.g. @xmath88yb and @xmath89sr isotopes ) , in which various interaction - driven phenomena can be addressed in a flat band .    \n 10 url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2]#2 [ 2][]#2    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , , , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ solid state physics : essential concepts _ ( ) .    \n , , & _ _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , , & \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ \n _ ( ) . .    , , \n & . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ _ ( ) .    , , , & . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , , , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    , & . \n _ _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ condensed matter physics 2nd edn . _ \n ( john wiley , 2010 ) .    , , , & . _ _ * * , ( ) .    _ \n et  al . _ . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .    \n _ et  al . _ . _ \n _ * * , ( ) .

type d. _ melanogaster _ embryos have indicated that the _ bicoid _ morphogen distribution scales linearly with the size of the embryo @xcite , which would imply that as a function of the relative position in the embryo , the morphogen distribution is invariant . in general such scaled patterning \n is seen to be robust against environmental variations and genetic background variations @xcite . \n a natural question that arises in this context is - what are the mechanisms by which such scale invariant patterning is achieved ? \n the answer to this question is an involved one , which requires careful consideration depending on the specific biological context . while we are not going to address that issue in this letter \n , it would serve as the broad motivation for focusing our attention on a simple one dimensional lattice model for growth which exhibits such scaled growth pattern . \n for such scaled growth pattern , the density profile remains invariant in the scaled position variable @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position and @xmath2 the length of the lattice . \n this model that we would discuss , incorporates some of the ingredients involved in quasi one - dimensional biological growth process of individual fungi filament .    \n fungi are eukaryotes and can typically grow as cylindrical tubes ( hyphae ) , with the growth happening at the tip of fungi @xcite . the material required for growth is packaged as vesicles that are supplied to the growing tip by molecular motors . \n the molecular motors transport these materials using the microtubules tracks to the growing end of the hyphae . \n these vesicles bring fresh membrane , and regulators neccesary for growth . \n the growth process of fungal hyphae have a sense of persistence in one direction . \n in addition to linear growth of the filament , lateral branching of hypha also appears giving rise to a network termed as _ mycelium _ @xcite . \n fungal mycelium exhibits patterning and it has also been observed that the spatial pattern associated with morphogenesis in fungi during spore germination requires the presence of microtubules @xcite .    \n we model the growing fungal filament as a one dimensional lattice which can grow at the one of the ends of the lattice . \n the model that we study belongs to the class of driven lattice gas models and a generalization of the model of dynamic lattice first proposed and studied in @xcite . \n driven lattice gas models have been used to model a number of biological processes , such as the motion of ribosomes in m - rna  @xcite , motor and vesicle transport  @xcite , transport across biomembranes  @xcite and growth of fungal hyphae @xcite . \n many of these models are based on the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , in which the particles jumps unidirectionally on the lattice with a single rate and interacts with other particle via hard - core repulsion . for tasep , the entire non - equilibrium phase diagram in terms of particle fluxes at the boundaries , has been worked out exactly@xcite . \n tasep has been generalized to incorporate a dynamically extending lattice , which is growing at one the ends of the lattice @xcite . for such dynamically extending tasep , the growth velocity at tip is proportional to the particle density at the tip and this minimal model has been proposed to describe the growth of fungal hyphae @xcite . \n number of other kinds of dynamic lattice gas models have studied in varied context such as a dynamic lattice coupled to a diffusive reservoir @xcite and a dynamic lattice which includes process of corrosion@xcite .    \n here we consider the coupling of the lattice growth process with langmuir kinetics . \n for the case of growth of fungal hyphae , the fact that the transported cargo may detach ( and reattach ) to the microtubule filament makes it plausible scenario to explore . \n in particular , we study the dynamic regime where these two processes compete ; the kinetic rates are such that fluxes of the particles at the boundaries are comparable to that fluxes in the bulk . for a static lattice , the competition beween particle fluxes at the boundaries with the process of particle exchange with the surrounding \n bath has been addressed in @xcite . \n we study this competition in context of dynamically extending lattice , focussing on a regime where the site attachment and detachment rates scale inversely as the system size . \n we use mean field ( mf ) analysis to study the system and compare these results with those obtained by perfoming monte carlo simulations . \n we find that the competition between the growth process and kinetics of attachment and detachment not only leads to the possibility of phase coexistence and shocks in the co - moving frame of the growing lattice , it also implies scale invariant density profile in the growing lattice . \n this dynamic regime exhibits qualitatively new scenario when compared to the situation when the growing lattice is coupled to a bulk reservoir where the total attachment and detachment rates scales extensively with the filament size @xcite .    \n we represent the growing filament at any instant of time to be a one -

equilibrium phase diagram can be constructed once we determine the limits of coexistence of the phases . \n phase coexistence in bulk can occur when the densities in the linear phases ( ld or hd ) matches with the density of the homogenous solution ( u ) at @xmath55 , in the domain range @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is position of the domain wall separating the two phases . for ld phase to coexist with the hd phase , current of the ld phase must equal the particle current in the hd phase at domain wall position @xmath58 in the domain @xmath56 . \n phases on the either side of the domain wall would have a density profile corresponding to the particular phase on the growing lattice . \n the phase boundaries are determined by the condition of expulsion of one of the phases from the bulk , i.e ; by setting the location of the domain wall position to the filament boundaries . while the density changes continuously on moving across the phase boundary separating the u region with the hd(ld ) region , the density change is dicontinuous while moving from a ld region to a hd region .    in order to analytically determine the mf density profile and the phase boundaries , separating the different phase regions \n , we again use the approximation introduced in eq.([eq : approx ] ) , so that the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined by eq.([eq : rho1a ] ) and eq.([eq : rho2 ] ) , as before . \n this approximation scheme implicitly assumes that @xmath59 is determined by the boundary conditions at the growing end of the filament alone . \n this is valid when the bulk density adjoining @xmath61 is determined by the growth rate at growing top alone , and the rate of tip growth is the rate limiting process which controls the bulk density adjoining the region of the growing tip . \n however when entire bulk phase is a ld phase and the hd phase is totally expelled from the growing end of the filament , then this approximation will not hold good . \n as long as the high density phase is present in the bulk , this approximation is reasonable , as confirmed by monte carlo simulations and illustrated in fig.2 . \n the condition for linear solution is then , @xmath62 \\label{eq : condlin}\\ ] ] and the corresponding expressions for mf density profile for the ld , u and hd phases are respectively ,    @xmath63{ll }   \\rho_{hd}(x ) = 1 -

hd phase coexistence region is obtained by letting the domain wall position @xmath73 . for a finite value of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the condition of linearity for the coexisting ld and hd profile is set by it . \n consequently if one approaches @xmath76 from the right , the boundary density for site 1 and 2 can be obtained using eq.([eq : rho1a ] ) and eq.([eq : rho2 ] ) and the condition for linear profile is set by eq.([eq : condlin ] ) . since the phase boundary can be obtained by the limiting procedure of setting the domain wall position @xmath57 to @xmath72 , approaching from the right , thus the phase boundary itself \n may be determined using the same condition of linearity as eq.([eq : condlin ] ) and value of @xmath59 is determined by eq.([eq : rho1a ] ) although the ld phase on the otherside of the phase boundary in the phase diagram would not satisfy the same condition for linear solution as before .    \n _ phase coexistence line between the ld - hd and ld - u - hd : _ if we require that the density for ld phase is same as that of u phase at the domain wall location , then the expression for position of the domain wall is @xmath77 . \n similarly expression for the domain wall position separating hd with u region is @xmath78 . \n the condition for phase coexistence boundary is that @xmath79 . \n thus we obtain the equation for phase boundary as , @xmath80\\ ] ]    _ phase coexistence line between the hd and hd - u : _ by matching the density for the hd phase with the density in u phase at @xmath54 , we obtain the equation in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath81 since @xmath82 , we numerically solve eq.([eq : pb7 ] ) to determine the value of @xmath7 corresponding to the phase boundary .    \n _ phase coexistence line between the u and hd - u : _ this is determined by matching the density for the hd phase , with the density in u phase at @xmath61 . thus the equation of phase boundary is , @xmath83    thus we see that above this critical value of @xmath7 determined by eq.([eq : mmh ] ) , the high density phase is expelled from the bulk of the lattice . in such situation \n the only possibilities are that of homogenous @xmath84 phase , a pure @xmath85 phase and @xmath86 phase coexistence .    for a pure ld phase , \n the rate limiting process is the input rate @xmath9 , so that the linear profile , @xmath87 would occupy the entire bulk of the lattice , right upto the growing end of the filament . in such circumstances , in order to determine the boundary value of density at @xmath61 , we use the approximation ,    @xmath88    this approximation also would imply that @xmath89 . \n thus the corresponding linear solution for the low density profile would then have to satisfy the condition ,    @xmath90    this condition for linear solution is different from the condition of linearity expressed in eq.([eq : condlin ] ) , where the hd phase was present in the bulk .    . \n [ fig3 ]    _ phase coexistence line between the ld and ld - u : _ this is determined by matching the density for the ld phase , with the density in u phase at @xmath61 . the value of density for the ld mean field solution at @xmath61 is , @xmath91 . \n the homogenous solution which determines the u phase density is given by @xmath92 . \n we use the approximation of eq.([eq : ap2 ] ) and the steady state condition corresponding to eq.([eq : bound1 ] ) , to obtain the corresponding expression for the @xmath93 . by equating the expressions for the densities in the two phases , \n we obtain we density at the left boundary as @xmath94 $ ] , and the equation for the phase coexistence boundary is , @xmath95 the corresponding condition for linear solution is , @xmath96 .    _ \n phase coexistence line between the u and ld - u : _ the coexistence boundary is determined by matching the density for the ld phase with the density in u phase at @xmath54 . for this case @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where we have again made use of the approximation , @xmath99    thus the equation of phase boundary is , @xmath100 the corresponding condition for linear solution is , @xmath101 the mf phase diagram in fig . \n [ fig3 ] displays the phase space cut along @xmath102 plane for a special choice of parameter values which are consistent with the constraint requirement specified by eq.([eq : lincond ] ) . \n fig.[fig3 ] illustrates how with the increase of @xmath64 , regions of phase coexistence in the bulk is expanded . \n when the langmuir kinetic process is switched off , then the dynamics of the model reduces to the case of a dynamic tasep studied in ref.@xcite . \n fig .  \n [ fig3](a ) compares the phase boundaries obtained for the case when @xmath103 with the results obtained in ref.@xcite for dynamic tasep . \n while the hd - u and ld - hd phase boundary obtained in this case is exactly the same as that obtained in ref.@xcite , the location of ld - u phase coexistence lines differ due to the approximations made through eq.([eq : ap3 ] ) . \n although the aspects of phase coexistence and presence of density shocks in the bulk , have many similarities with the phase diagram for tasep - lk process for static lattice @xcite , the topology of the phase diagram in this case differs significantly . \n comparison of the results obtained by this approximate mf analysis with monte carlo simulations reveal that while their is broad qualitative agreement for the density profiles and the rough location of the phase boundaries , the mf density profile does not exactly match with the actual density profile obtained by monte carlo simulation . \n the mf analysis is also not able to accurately determine the exact location of the phase boundaries . \n however the feature of scale invariant density profile predicted by the mf analysis is robust as seen by comparison with monte carlo simulations done for different system sizes .    in summary , we have presented a model of dynamically extended lattice which incorporates the process of langmuir kinetics and exhibits feature of scale invariant density profile in the bulk . \n it also rationalizes in simple terms the interplay of the various competing processes which affect growth . in particular \n it highlights the dynamic regime for which the bulk process of langmuir kinetics competes with the boundary processes of particle input and growth at the tip . \n the resultant phase diagram shows rich behavior , which includes different inhomogeneous phases , phase coexistence in bulk and the possibility of density shocks . \n this model will have significant ramification in modeling transport and growth in fungal _ \n the emergence of scale invariant patterned growth which can be altered by the interplay of internal regulatory mechanisms with environment effects , makes it a useful minimal model which may be suitably modified for modeling branching and patterning in fungal _ \n mycelium_. the framework that we discuss provides a natural means to link internal regulatory mechanism like vesicle supply rate with the branching or tip growth rates which can be dependent on external cues @xcite . \n the possible extensions of this model can involve extending the model to include bidirectional transport along the filament and a more realistic biological scenario would also involve generalizing it to account for transport on multiple parallel tracks , as is the case for transport in fungal hyphae @xcite . \n it would then be interesting to study whether transport on multiple tracks can lead to phase segregation of material within the tracks as has been seen in @xcite .

mediated susy breaking scenario is plausible . in the context of the weakly coupled heterotic @xmath3 superstring , \n @xmath4 is considered to be the hidden sector gauge symmetry . if supersymmetric gauge dynamics in the hidden sector , such as gaugino condensation , cause susy breaking to occur , the effects of the susy breaking will be transmitted to the observable sector through gravitational interactions . in these types of simple models@xcite \n , the @xmath5-components of moduli fields other than the dilaton are expected to develop their vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . \n the gauginos acquire their soft susy breaking masses at one loop , but not at the tree level . as a consequence , \n the gaugino masses turn out to be too small compared to the soft scalar masses . \n namely , we have the relations @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the gaugino mass , the soft scalar mass and the gravitino mass , respectively . \n this mass spectrum of superparticles is phenomenologically unacceptable . \n although it has been pointed out that this problem can be solved in strongly coupled heterotic @xmath3 superstring theory ( m - theory)@xcite@xcite , there remains another problem regarding non - universality of the soft breaking mass parameters . since in string theory the moduli fields are generally charged under the flavor symmetry , the soft scalar masses become flavor - dependent . as a result of these non - universal properties for the scalar masses , \n we are confronted with the so - called fcnc problem . with regard to this point \n , the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario has the advantage of producing the universal soft scalar masses and then ensuring sufficient suppression of the fcnc .    in this paper \n we propose a new model based on the weakly coupled heterotic string on the calabi - yau compactification , whose superparticle mass spectrum is phenomenologically viable and which is free from the fcnc problem . \n the breakdown of susy coming from the hidden sector gaugino condensation begins by being transmitted to anti -

energy mssm sector occurs via gauge interactions . \n then the gaugino masses are of the same order as the soft scalar masses . \n in addition , due to the flavor - blind nature of gauge interactions , we obtain the universal soft scalar masses .    \n the four - dimensional effective theory in the observable sector from the weakly coupled calabi - yau string is characterized by @xmath2 susy , the @xmath11 gauge group , and massless matter fields which belong to @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations in @xmath11 . \n the massless chiral superfields apart from @xmath11 singlets consist of @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the family number at low energies . \n @xmath16 sets of vector -

triplet higgses @xmath23 and @xmath24 and a singlet @xmath25 as well as the quark superfield @xmath26 lepton superfield @xmath27 and \n higgs doublets @xmath28 . \n moreover , there appear a dilaton field @xmath29 , @xmath19 khler class moduli fields @xmath30 , and @xmath18 complex structure moduli fields @xmath31 . \n the vev of a dilaton field @xmath29 determines the gauge coupling constant , and the vevs of the moduli fields @xmath31 and @xmath30 parametrize the size and shapes of the compactified manifold . in the observable sector from the calabi -

dominated susy breaking scenario@xcite . \n hereafter we denote the vev of the moduli field @xmath10 by the same letter as the field . \n for example , we write @xmath42 .    in eq . \n ( [ eqn3 ] ) the trilinear coupling of @xmath34 contains the terms @xmath43 if the singlet field @xmath44 acquires a nonvanishing vev @xmath45 @xcite , then @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xmath34 gain supersymmetric masses @xmath50 also , we have the soft susy breaking scalar masses , which are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath10 . therefore , the scalar particles in @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the masses squared @xmath53 .    since only the anti - generation fields @xmath34 couple to the @xmath10 moduli , the fields @xmath34 behave as messenger fields in the framework of the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario . \n it should be noted that the flavor dependence of @xmath54 is not transmitted to the generation fields @xmath40 . in the gut - type models which accommodate the mssm at low energies , @xmath45 and @xmath55 \n are expected to be larger than @xmath56 gev @xcite . in this case \n these messenger fields will become sufficiently heavy compared to the electroweak scale . \n the other extra fields belonging to one set of the vector - like multiplet also become massive near or slightly above the intermediate energy scale via nonrenormalizable interactions @xcite . on the other hand , due to vanishing @xmath5-terms of the @xmath38 moduli , the generation fields @xmath40 can not behave as messenger fields . \n the messenger fields @xmath34 have the quantum number of the standard model gauge group . \n therefore , integrating out the messenger sector gives rise to gaugino masses at one loop . \n estimating one - loop diagrams , one finds that the gaugino masses induced are @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the @xmath59s are the gauge coupling constants ( @xmath60 ) . \n the soft scalar masses in the low - energy mssm sector , in which @xmath61 sets of the generation fields @xmath62 remain light , arise at leading order from two - loop diagrams . \n messenger fields , gauge bosons and gauginos take part in the internal lines of the two - loop diagrams . consequently , \n the soft scalar masses induced are of the same order as the gaugino masses : @xmath63 provided that @xmath64 is @xmath65 , the mass spectrum of superparticles is consistent with that in the mssm . \n as mentioned above , the significant features of this scenario are that there are sufficient degeneracies among squarks ( sleptons ) to ensure adequate suppression of fcnc and that no new @xmath66 phases are induced in soft susy breaking parameters .    as a consequence of the worldsheet instanton effects , @xmath37 is of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant . \n @xmath69 is related to the compactification radius @xmath70 as @xmath71 in units of the string scale . \n the string scale @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the string tension . from eq . \n ( [ eqn10 ] ) , @xmath64 in eq . \n ( [ eqn8 ] ) becomes @xmath75 . in view of the fact that @xmath76 corresponds to an axion - like field , it is adequate for us to require the periodicity of @xmath37 in units of the string scale . \n in this context we postulate that @xmath77 . \n thus , we have @xmath78 with the scale @xmath79 , we find that the gaugino masses are on the order of a few hundred gev .    \n now we proceed to discuss the gravitino mass . in the \n weakly coupled heterotic string , the khler potential is given by @xcite @xmath80 here the dots represent the higher - order terms . using the above khler potential and assuming a vanishing cosmological constant , we obtain the gravitino mass @xmath81 in string theory , the compactification radius is expected to be around the inverse string scale . from eqs . \n ( [ eqn9 ] ) , ( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn13 ] ) we obtain the phenomenologically viable relations @xmath82 since the gaugino mass and the scalar mass are also induced by gravitational interactions , we must study whether or not the gauge - mediated contribution is dominated by a gravity - mediated contribution . in the \n weakly coupled heterotic string , the gauge - kinetic function in the observable sector is of the form @xmath83 , and we have @xmath84 in the weak coupling region . \n the second term in @xmath85 comes from the string one - loop correction and @xmath86 is a small constant fixed by gauge and gravitational anomaly@xcite@xcite . \n the gravity - mediated contribution to the gaugino mass is given by @xmath87 since we have @xmath88 at the unification scale , eq . \n ( [ eqn15 ] ) cac be rewritten as @xmath89 from eqs . \n ( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn16 ] ) the ratio of @xmath90 to @xmath91 becomes @xmath92 further , the gravity - mediated contribution to the scalar mass is given by @xmath93 up to a one - loop correction @xcite . \n then the ratio of @xmath94 to @xmath8 becomes @xmath95 where we have taken @xmath96 at the unification scale . as can be deduced from eqs . \n ( @xmath97 ) and ( @xmath98 ) , the gauge - mediated contribution to the gaugino mass and scalar mass are dominant compared to the gravity - mediated contribution .    \n finally , we discuss the @xmath99 problem . in the present model the @xmath99 term comes from the first term in eq . \n ( [ eqn3 ] ) with @xmath100 . \n the @xmath101 term is generated in the two - loop diagram as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . \n the messenger fields ( @xmath34 ) propagate in the innermost loop . \n the external lines are the scalar fields @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the remaining internal line has the fermion mass insertion @xmath104 . \n the ratio of @xmath105 to @xmath106 becomes @xmath107 provided that @xmath108 . introducing a certain type of flavor symmetry , \n we can obtain @xmath109 @xcite . \n thus , the @xmath99 problem is solved .    in conclusion \n , we propose a new model of susy breaking mediation on the basis of the weakly coupled heterotic string on the calabi - yau compactification . in this model \n , susy breaking is mediated to the mssm sector by two phases . in the first phase , \n susy breaking in the hidden sector is transmitted to anti - generation fields via gravitational interactions . \n subsequent transmission of susy breaking occurs via gauge interactions . \n although the moduli fields are charged under the flavor symmetries , due to the flavor - blind nature of gauge interactions , we obtain the universal soft scalar masses . \n the mass spectra of superparticles obtained here are phenomenologically viable .

{"id": 806, "abstract": " i describe the einstein s gravitation of 3 + 1 dimensional spacetimes using the ( 2,2 ) formalism without assuming isometries . in this formalism \n , quasi - local energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum are identified from the four einstein s equations of the divergence - type , and are expressed geometrically in terms of the area of a two - surface and a pair of null vector fields on that surface . \n the associated quasi - local balance equations are spelled out , and the corresponding fluxes are found to assume the canonical form of energy - momentum flux as in standard field theories . \n the remaining non - divergence - type einstein s equations turn out to be the hamilton s equations of motion , which are derivable from the _ non - vanishing \n _ hamiltonian by the variational principle . \n the hamilton s equations are the evolution equations along the out - going null geodesic whose _ affine _ parameter serves as the time function . in the asymptotic region of asymptotically flat spacetimes \n , it is shown that the quasi - local quantities reduce to the bondi energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum , and the corresponding fluxes become the bondi fluxes . \n the quasi - local angular momentum turns out to be zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime . \n i also present a candidate for quasi - local _ rotational _ energy which agrees with the carter s constant in the asymptotic region of the kerr spacetime . \n finally , a simple relation between energy - flux and angular momentum - flux of a generic gravitational radiation is discussed , whose existence reflects the fact that energy - flux always accompanies angular momentum - flux unless the flux is an @xmath0-wave .    \n introduction[intro ]    it has been known for sometime that the plebaski equation@xcite , the self - dual einstein s equation of 4 dimensional euclidean space , can be obtained as the large @xmath1 limit of the equations of motion of a certain class of @xmath2-valued non - linear sigma models in 2 dimensions@xcite . \n the equivalence of these equations defined in two different dimensions is quite unexpected , but if one realizes that large @xmath1 limit of the @xmath2 lie algebra is just the lie algebra of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of an auxiliary 2 dimensional surface@xcite , and that the equations of motion of @xmath3-valued non - linear sigma models in 2 dimensions are in fact partial differential equations on 4 dimensional space , then one might be more comfortable with the idea of describing 4 dimensional self - dual einstein s gravity as a limit of a certain class of 2 dimensional field theories , and can show that the two theories are in fact identical . this correspondence is supported further by the observation that the plebaski equation and the @xmath2-valued 2-dimensional non - linear sigma models are both integrable .    one may be interested in extending this idea of describing 3 + 1 dimensional theories from 1 + 1 dimensional perspective without the self - dual restriction and in the lorentzian regime . \n there are several advantages of such a description , if it is possible at all . \n they stem from the fact that 1 + 1 dimensional field theories are usually more manageable than 3 + 1 dimensional ones , both classically and quantum mechanically . \n for example , a number of field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions are renormalizable , due to the _ dimensionlessness _ of field variables in a naive power counting . \n there would be an enormous gain if one ever succeeds in describing the einstein s gravitation in 3 + 1 dimensions as a limit of some kind of 1 + 1 dimensional field theories which eventually proves to be renormalizable . \n this idea sounds strange but does not seem impossible , since the renormalizability is highly sensitive to the spacetime dimensions on which the theories are defined \n .    these reasonings led us to seek the possibility whether the einstein s gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions without the self - dual restriction is describable as a 1 + 1 dimensional field theory@xcite . \n the idea was simply to split a 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime into a 1 + 1 dimensional base manifold and a 2 dimensional fibre space , and write down the einstein - hilbert action . \n then the einstein - hilbert action becomes 1 + 1 dimensional field theory action , where the infinite dimensional group of diffeomorphisms of 2 dimensional fibre space becomes the yang - mills gauge symmetry . \n but this program was successful only in a formal sense , since the resulting 1 + 1 dimensional action did not seem much useful , which made the whole idea of describing the einstein s gravitation as 1 + 1 dimensional field theory questionable . \n the follow - up idea was to use the gauge freedom of the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime@xcite . \n if one chooses one of the spacetime coordinates as the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic , then it turns out that the 1 + 1 dimensional field theory description of the einstein s gravitation is simplified significantly .    \n the purpose of this paper is to present several unexpected results that i obtained in the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle description of the einstein s gravitation , and discuss their physical implications . \n first , i will present quasi - local balance equations of energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum for an arbitrary compact two - surface , which are just two - surface integrals of the four divergence - type equations that are part of the einstein s equations@xcite . \n quasi - local energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum are expressed in the coordinate - independent and geometric way in terms of the area of a two - surface and the in- and out - going null vector fields at each point of that surface@xcite . \n they are bondi - like , since their rates of changes are given by fluxes of the canonical form@xcite t_0^ ~_i _ i _ q^i , where @xmath4 is an appropriate vector field defined at each point of a two - surface .    \n second , problems of defining quasi - local angular momentum and associated rotational energy have been particularly subtle issues@xcite . \n this is due to the fact that the very notion of rotation depends on the choice of the coordinates , which implies that one can always remove the effects of rotation by working in a co - rotating coordinate system . on the other hand , \n it is natural to demand that the angular momentum and the rotational energy of any compact two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime be zero . \n it will be seen that our quasi - local angular momentum and rotational energy not only become zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime , but also reduce to the standard values of the total angular momentum and the _ carter s constant _ in the asymptotic region of the kerr spacetime , respectively@xcite . in this sense \n , our quasi - local rotational energy may be regarded as a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant of a generic gravitational field .    \n third , using the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic as the time coordinate , i will write down the hamiltonian of the einstein s theory@xcite . \n i will obtain the hamilton s equations of motion from this hamiltonian using appropriate boundary conditions , which determine the time flows of the field variables . \n together with the quasi - local balance equations ( or the constraint equations depending on the signature of the 3-dimensional hypersurface ) , it will be seen that the hamilton s equations of motion constitute the full einstein s equations .    \n finally , i will present a simple but general relation between quasi - local energy - flux and angular momentum - flux of a generic gravitational radiation that has no isometries . \n it is a generalization of the well - known relation of mass - loss and angular momentum - loss@xcite , = m_zl_z [ algae ] for small perturbations around a stationary and axi - symmetric spacetime , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the frequency and azimuthal angular momentum of the perturbations , respectively . to my knowledge , \n such a relation between these gravitational fluxes of the most general type has not been discussed before , but it strongly indicates that our identifications of fluxes are physically correct , since energy - flux always carries angular momentum - flux unless the radiation is an @xmath0-wave .    \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ kine ] , i will introduce the kinematics of the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism , and write down the einstein s equations . \n then i will discuss 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory aspects of the einstein s gravitation of 3 + 1 dimensions from this fibre bundle point of view .    in section [ out ] , i will study the four einstein s equations that are first - order in the derivatives along the out - going null vector field . \n these equations , which are the natural analogs of the einstein s constraint equations in the 3 + 1 formalism , turn out to be divergence - type equations . \n it is from the two - surface integrals of these equations that one obtains quasi - local balance equations of gravitational energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum . \n i will also present quasi - local gravitational rotational energy . \n the carter s constant , which is usually interpreted as a measure of intrinsic rotation of gravitational field , is known to exist for a certain class of spacetimes that have two commuting killing symmetries , and for the kerr spacetime , it is just the total angular momentum squared . \n our quasi - local rotational energy reduces to the carter s constant for asymptotically kerr spacetimes , as is shown in [ k2 ] , and therefore , may be regarded as a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant to spacetimes that have no isometries .    in section [ hameq ] , it will be shown that the remaining einstein s equations , which are second - order in the derivatives along the out - going null vector field , are the hamilton s equations of motion derivable from a non - vanishing hamiltonian by the variational principle . \n the details of this derivation are given in appendix . \n thus , together with the quasi - local balance equations ( or constraint equations depending on the signature of the 3-dimensional hypersurface ) , the hamilton s equations of motion make up for the full einstein s equations in this formalism .    in section [ geom ] , quasi - local energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum of the previous sections \n will be expressed in the coordinate - independent and geometric way , using the area of a two - surface and a pair of null vector fields orthogonal to that surface . \n relative to a given background spacetime against which these quasi - local quantities are measured , quasi - local energy and linear momentum are given by the rates of changes of the area of the two - surface along the in- and out - going null vector fields , respectively , and quasi - local angular momentum associated with a vector field @xmath7 is given by two - surface integral of the projection of the _ twist _ of the in- and out - going null vector fields onto @xmath7 modulo a background - dependent subtraction term .    \n in section [ k2 ] , i will study the quasi - local balance equations at the null infinity and show that they all agree with the well - known bondi formulae of energy - loss , momentum - loss , and angular momentum - loss . in order to show these correspondences , \n it is necessary to find the asymptotic fall - off rates of the metric and their derivatives near the null infinity , using the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic as the radial coordinate@xcite . \n i will present the asymptotic fall - off rates in this section . \n it will be shown that the quasi - local rotational energy in the asymptotic region of the asymptotically kerr spacetimes agrees with the carter s constant of the kerr spacetime .    in section \n [ relation ] , a general relation between quasi - local energy - flux and angular momentum - flux will be presented for a generic gravitational radiation . when restricted to small perturbations around a stationary and axi - symmetric spacetime \n , it will be shown that this relation reduces to the well - known relation of mass - loss and angular momentum - loss in the perturbation theory of the kerr black hole@xcite .    in the appendix , \n i present in detail the derivation of the non - divergence type einstein s equations as the hamilton s equations of motion associated with a non - vanishing gravitational hamiltonian .    \n kinematics[kine ]    @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10    in this section , i will introduce the kinematics of the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism@xcite , and write down the einstein s equations . \n this section serves mainly to fix the notations . \n let us consider the following line element @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for @xmath13 , respectively @xcite . \n in order to understand the geometry of this metric , it is convenient to introduce the following vector fields @xmath14 defined as & & _ + : = _ + -

> = -1 , < _ - ,  _ \n - > = 0 , + & & < _ ,  _ a > = 0 , < _ a ,  _ b > = _ ab . the hypersurface @xmath16 is an out - going null hypersurface generated by @xmath17 whose norm is zero . \n the hypersurface @xmath18 is generated by @xmath19 whose norm is @xmath20 , which can be either negative , zero , or positive , depending on whether @xmath19 is timelike , null , or spacelike , respectively . \n the vector fields @xmath14 are called horizontal since they are orthogonal to @xmath21 , and two dimensional section spanned by @xmath14 has the lorentzian signature . \n the intersection of two hypersurfaces @xmath22 defines a spacelike two -

[ intgauss ] thus , in maxwell s theory , the difference of two - surface integrals of the `` momentum '' @xmath97 on two successive two - spheres is given by the spatial integral of the charge `` density '' over the volume between the two - spheres . in this paper , however , we shall be concerned with the case @xmath83 only , and the case @xmath98 will be discussed elsewhere@xcite .    if we introduce a function @xmath99 defined as w_r(u , v ) : = 116^u_0 du d^2y a_+^  a_+_a , [ w1 ] then we have w_r(u , v ) = 116 d^2y a_+^  a_+_a , [ w2 ] so that ( [ enflux1 ] ) can be written as @xmath100 notice that the r.h.s . of ( [ w2 ] ) \n has the form w_r(u , v ) ~_a^a_+ l_a , where & & ^a ~a_+^  a , [ ural ] + & & l_a ~116_a , [ ironshark ] which represents the work done per unit @xmath90-time by changing the angular momentum @xmath101 of the system that has the angular velocity @xmath102 . from this perspective \n , the equation ( [ w2 ] ) is the work done on @xmath23 per unit @xmath90-time by changing the angular momentum density @xmath103 of gravitational field that has the angular velocity @xmath86 at each point of @xmath23 . \n this observation suggests that @xmath99 be identified as the quasi - local _ rotational _ energy of @xmath23 . \n indeed , as is shown in section [ k2 ] , @xmath99 reduces to the carter s constant for the asymptotically kerr spacetimes , the total angular momentum squared@xcite . \n this is a strong indication that supports our identification of @xmath99 as the rotational energy of gravitational field in the circumstances where _ no _ isometries are present .    in the limit where @xmath86 is independent of @xmath90 such that \n _ + a_+^  a=0 , [ w4 ] @xmath99 becomes w_r(u , v ) = 116_u = u d^2y ( a_+^  a_a ) -116_u=0 d^2y ( a_+^  a_a ) . \n [ w5 ]    hamilton s equations of motion[hameq ]    let us define the hamiltonian @xmath104 as the integral of @xmath64 in ( [ tilde ] ) , k:= du d^2y \\ \n { h+ ( det  _ a b - 1 ) } , [ fundam ] where @xmath105 is a lagrange multiplier that enforces the unimodular condition ( [ hammerhead ] ) . in the appendix \n , we have shown that the equations ( [ cc ] ) , ( [ dd ] ) , ( [ fff ] ) , and ( [ ggg ] ) are the hamilton s equations of motion & & d_-q^i= k _ i , [ defm ] + & & d_-_i= -k q^i , [ defe ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 are _ \n i=\\ { _ h , _ , _ \n a , ^a b } , q^i=\\ { h , , a_+ ^  a , _ a b } , assuming the boundary conditions = _ a b = 0 [ bcon ] at the endpoints of the @xmath90-integration . \n thus , together with the divergence - type einstein s equations ( [ aa ] ) , ( [ bb ] ) , and ( [ ee ] ) , from which follow the integral equations ( [ enflux ] ) , ( [ momflux ] ) , and ( [ angflux ] ) that may be interpreted as either the quasi - local balance equations or constraint equations depending on the signature of the 3-dimensional hypersuface , the hamilton s equations of motion ( [ defm ] ) and ( [ defe ] ) make up for the complete set of the vacuum einstein s equations . thus , in the ( 2,2 ) \n fibre bundle formalism , the einstein s equations split into twelve first - order hamilton s equations of motion dictating the evolution along the out - going null geodesic and the four quasi - local balance equations or the constraint equations that implement the hamilton s evolution equations .    \n geometrical interpretations[geom ]    two - surface integrals ( [ enint ] ) , ( [ momint ] ) , and ( [ angint ] ) can be given geometric interpretations in terms of the area of @xmath23 and null vector fields orthogonal to @xmath23 . in order to see this , \n it is necessary to recall the definitions of the in- and out - going null vector fields @xmath1 and @xmath32 given by ( [ en ] ) and ( [ el ] ) , respectively .    \n quasi - local energy[geom1 ]    let us observe that , apart from the subtraction term @xmath78 , ( [ enint ] ) can be written as the lie derivative of the area @xmath108 of @xmath23 along @xmath1 . \n notice that we have d^2y ( h _ h + 2 e^ d_+ ) & = & 2 d^2y e^ ( d_+- h d_- ) + & = & 2 d^2y  _ ne^. [ triv ] but one has d^2y  _ \n ne^=  _ n a , [ inter ] where @xmath109 is given by = d^2y e^. the identity ( [ inter ] ) follows from the fact that the order of @xmath110 integration and the lie derivation @xmath111 is interchangeable , since the in - going null vector field @xmath1 is orthogonal to @xmath23 . \n thus we have u(u , v)=1 8  _ na + |u . [ bailfish ] in order to fix @xmath78 , it is necessary to introduce a reference spacetime . in principle \n , the reference spacetime can be chosen arbitrarily , provided that the pull - back of the background metric to @xmath23 is the same as @xmath112 . \n if we denote the coordinates of the reference spacetime as @xmath113 , then its metric can be written as @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the embedding degrees of freedom of @xmath23 into the reference spacetime . \n the vector fields @xmath116 , @xmath117 & &    & & |l= ( |v - |a_-^  ay^a ) [ elbar ] are null with respect to the background metric , and satisfy the same normalization conditions as before , _ \n ref=0 , < |l ,  |l > _ ref=0 , < |n ,  |l > _ ref=-1 . \n [ grouse ] if @xmath78 is chosen as |u:=-1 8  _ \n |na [ ubar ] such that it satisfies the @xmath90-independent condition = 0 , [ grouper ] then ( [ bailfish ] ) becomes u(u , v ) = 1 8  _ \n ( n-|n)a . [ eninta ] this expression is entirely geometrical , stating that @xmath74 is determined by the rate of change of the area @xmath109 of @xmath23 along the difference @xmath118 of the in - going null geodesics , and becomes zero when n=|n .    \n quasi - local linear momentum[geom2 ]    one can also express @xmath75 geometrically . let us notice that d^2y ( _ h ) = -1 8 d^2y e^ d_-=-1 8 d^2y e^  _ \n l = -1 8_la . \n [ mominta ] therefore , if we choose the subtraction term @xmath79 as    @xmath90-independent condition |p=0 , [ pbarcon ] then ( [ momint ] ) becomes p(u , v)=-1 8_(l-|l)a . \n [ momintb ] thus , @xmath75 is given by the minus of the rate of change of the area @xmath109 of @xmath23 along the difference @xmath119 of the out - going null geodesics , and becomes zero when l=|l .    \n quasi - local angular momentum[geom3 ]    let us now find the geometrical expression of @xmath76 . if we notice that the lie bracket of @xmath1 and @xmath32 is given by _ \n l = -f_+-^  a_a + ( d_-h ) l , [ brown ] then we have d^2y ( ^a_a ) & = & 1 16 d^2y e^ _ a f_+-^  a + & = & -1 16 d^2y e^ _ a [ n ,  l ] _ l^a + & = & -1 16 d^2y e^ < ,  [ n ,  l ] _ \n l > , [ twist ] where we used _ \n e^ _ a b ^b , [ xidef ] and the fact that @xmath32 is orthogonal to @xmath7 , l^a _ a=0 . \n [ marlin ] if we choose the subtraction term @xmath80 as |l : = 1 16 d^2y e^ < ,  [ |n ,  |l ] _ l>_ref , [ elref ] and require that the condition |l = 0 [ elbarr ] hold , then ( [ angint ] ) becomes l(u , v ;

[ calca ] if we choose the constant of @xmath90-integration as zero , then we have _ vv^3w_r=(ma)^2 , [ very ] which is just the total angular momentum squared for the kerr spacetime . \n thus , @xmath131 may be regarded as a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant@xcite , and physically , could be interpreted as gravitational contribution to the quasi - local rotational energy .    \n relation between energy - loss and angular momentum - loss [ relation ]    in general , if a given system undergoes an energy - losing process , then it always accompanies angular momentum - loss , unless the system remains spherically symmetric throughout the whole process . \n since we already found general expressions of quasi - local energy - flux and angular momentum - flux , it is natural to ask what relation exists between them , if there is any . \n the relation is that the angular momentum - flux ( [ angflux ] ) and energy - flux ( [ enflux1 ] ) transform into each other @xmath155 under the exchange of the derivatives _ [ match ] in the flux integrals .    \n let us examine the implication of this symmetry for spacetimes _ close _ to a background spacetime that possesses two commuting killing vector fields . \n let us choose the coordinates of the background spacetime as @xmath156 , and let @xmath157 be two killing vector fields of the background spacetime . \n let us also suppose that the coordinates @xmath140 approach the coordinates of the background spacetime @xmath141 as @xmath142 , u |u , v |v , y^a \\ { , } . [ circa ]    if we perturb this background spacetime by adding a small amount of gravitational waves , then we may regard these waves as propagating in the background spacetime , carrying a small amount of energy and angular momentum . \n let us write @xmath56 and @xmath158 about an exact solution @xmath159 of the einstein s equations , & & q^i = |q^i(|v , ) + q^i , [ delq ] + & & _ i = |_i(|v , ) + _ i , where @xmath160 represents gravitational waves propagating on the background spacetime . \n the dependence of a given mode on @xmath161 and @xmath162 is given by & & q^i = q^i(|v , )  e^i |u + im_z + c.c . \n , [ barq ] + & & _ i=_i(|v , )  e^i |u + im_z + c.c . , [ barp ] where @xmath163 are the amplitudes of the wave that has the frequency @xmath5 and the azimuthal quantum number @xmath6 ( @xmath164 ) . \n now , if we use ( [ circa ] ) and the fact that @xmath165 are the timelike and azimuthal killing vector fields of the background spacetime , respectively , then from the symmetry ( [ cross ] ) and ( [ match ] ) we obtain the following relation@xcite = m_zd l_z d|u,[aero ] which is a well - known relation between energy - loss and angular momentum - loss for perturbations around the stationary and axi - symmetric spacetime . thus , the symmetry ( [ cross ] ) and ( [ match ] ) is the sought - for relation between the energy - loss and angular momentum - loss for a generic gravitational radiation that has no isometries .    \n discussions [ discuss ]    the key ingredient of the ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism discussed so far is the observation that the out - going null vector field defines a natural time flow . with the affine parameter of the out - going null geodesic as the time function of the theory , \n the canonical variables were introduced and the non - vanishing gravitational hamiltonian was spelled out . \n then i obtained the hamilton s equations of motion from the hamiltonian by the variational principle , which are the evolution equations along the out - going null geodesics with respect to the affine parameter . \n thus , in this paper , i have shown that the einstein s equations split into twelve first - order hamilton s equations of motion and the four quasi - local balance equations or constraint equations that implement the hamilton s evolution equations .    \n i also found coordinate - independent and geometric expressions of quasi - local gravitational energy , linear momentum , and angular momentum for any two - surface . \n the corresponding fluxes of gravitational field were found to assume the canonical form of energy - momentum flux , t_0^ ~_i_i_q^i , just as in standard field theories . \n i have shown that the quasi - local balance equations correctly reproduce the well - known bondi relations at the null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes . however , because of the breakdown of the coordinate system due to potential occurrence of caustics after a finite propagation along the out - going null geodesics , there could be difficulties in extending the hamilton s evolution equations beyond the caustics . in principle , however , it is still possible to approach the null infinity by using a new coordinate system after the breakdown of the old one , and perhaps one could use the quasi - local balance equations across the caustics and search for `` weak '' solutions@xcite . however , it must be mentioned that , the farther out one goes , the less likely is the chance for caustics to occur due to the weakness of gravity near the infinity . \n if one is interested in the strong gravity region near black holes , or black hole dynamics itself , then the caustics might cause serious problems since they are much more likely to occur as we approach strong gravity region along the in - going null geodesics .    \n quasi - local angular momentum was defined in this paper for spacetimes that have no isometries , and was found to be zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime . it was found to have the additive property , being a linear functional of a vector field @xmath7 that defines the rotation at each point of the two - surface . \n one might be interested in studying symmetry properties of this quasi - local angular momentum , and look for some generalization of the bms symmetries at a finite region@xcite .    \n in addition , i obtained a quasi - local generalization of the carter s constant of gravitational field , and interpreted it as gravitational contribution to the quasi - local rotational energy . \n the carter s constant is known to exist when the system under study has two commuting killing vector fields , such as the einstein - maxwell system and the einstein s equations coupled to a scalar field . for a generic gravitational field that has no isometries , no analog of the carter \n s constant is known . in this paper , \n i presented a candidate for the generalized carter s constant which becomes zero for any two - surface in the flat minkowski spacetime , and reduces to the total angular momentum squared in the asymptotic region of the kerr spacetime . \n it is interesting to see how this quasi - local carter s constant generalizes when the electromagnetic and scalar fields are present .    there could be a number of applications of the quasi - local balance equations in astrophysics . \n the most important and challenging problem seems to be the calculation of back - reaction on the geometry of black holes as a consequence of the emission or absorption of gravitational radiation . \n one could also use the quasi - local balance equations in searching for consistent boundary conditions at a finite boundary in numerical relativity , since the boundary data at a finite boundary must satisfy the quasi - local balance equations . \n these problems are left for future works .    \n another issue in this ( 2,2 ) formalism is the well - posedness of the initial value problem . when the initial 3 dimensional hypersurface is chosen spacelike , there is no problem in the well - posedness of the initial value problem since the null direction can be viewed as a limit of timelike direction . \n but there are several other choices of initial surfaces , such as the double null initial surfaces and the initial / boundary value problems where the boundary can be either timelike or null . \n one of the difficulties associated with the characteristic or initial / boundary value problem is that one has to know the `` flows of information '' across the characteristic or the timelike boundary that belongs to the future . in these hybrid formulations of the einstein s equations , not so many articles that aim to study the well - posedness of the field equations appeared . \n however , a series of the recent papers by frittelli@xcite shows that , for a certain choice of first - order variables for the characteristic problem of the _ linearized _ einstein s equations , the system can be cast into manifestly well - posed form . for the non - linear characteristic problems , \n the notion of well - posedness is still not available . \n it is interesting to examine whether the first - order variables in this paper might have any relevance in establishing the well - posedness of the non - linear characteristic initial value problem .    \n finally , there are problems related to the gauge invariance of this ( 2,2 ) fibre bundle formalism . \n it is obvious that this formalism is tied to a particular gauge , and the non - vanishing hamiltonian is obtained as a consequence of selecting a particular time function , namely , choosing the affine parameter along the null direction as the time function . \n but one should notice that , in the standard adm formalism , it is also possible to obtain another non - vanishing hamiltonian if one chooses a time function such as the gauss normal time coordinate@xcite . \n moreover , if one quantizes the theory in a particular gauge , the resulting quantum theory will depend on that gauge , losing the spacetime diffeomorphism invariance that one wishes to carry over to the quantum regime . in view of the present situation \n that there is not any single complete version of sensible quantum theory of gravity , however , this gauge problem does not seem to be an urgent problem . clearly , quantizing the full einstein s gravity is beyond the scope of the present paper .    \n * acknowledgments *     + it is a great pleasure to thank s. hollands , r. geroch for interesting discussions at the last stage of preparing this paper , and in particular , r. wald for the hospitality extended to the author during the sabbatical leave at the university of chicago . \n the author also thanks the referee for his criticism that helped to improve the original manuscript on several delicate issues .

{"id": 808, "abstract": " valleytronics targets the exploitation of the additional degrees of freedom in materials where the energy of the carriers may assume several equal minimum values ( valleys ) at non -

orbit interaction acting on the latter induces a @xmath6160mev energy splitting between spin - up and spin - down states , and determines opposite spin polarizations at the vb * k , k * ( fig.[fig1]a)@xcite . conversely , @xmath2 at the cb minima is provided by a small contribution from the _ p _ atomic orbitals of the chalcogen ( s ) atoms ( see table ii in ref . ) , resulting in a small spin - orbit splitting ( a few mev)@xcite . \n states with opposite spin at the bottom of the cb band are thus almost degenerate , meaning that the spin of conduction electrons is independent of the occupied valley@xcite . \n this strong coupling between momentum and spin makes single - layer tmds particularly appealing when compared to other valleytronics platforms , such as those based on silicon@xcite or graphene@xcite . \n the large spin - orbit interaction , combined with optical excitation by circularly polarized light , allows the photogeneration of electron ( _ e _ ) and hole ( _ h _ ) populations in the cb and vb , respectively , with up to 100@xmath7 spin and valley polarization@xcite .    thus , studying the dynamics of the relaxation of valley and spin polarization for both photoexcited e / h is crucial to understand the mechanisms leading to the loss of information that could be associated with these degrees of freedom . \n thanks to their peculiar electronic structure , tmds offer the unprecedented opportunity of comparing the dynamics of vb holes , where spin and valley dynamics are interlocked@xcite , with that of cb electrons , for which spin and valley index are completely decoupled@xcite . \n this allows for the direct evaluation of the stabilization that the coupling between spin and valley provides against perturbations .    \n the relaxation dynamics in tmds was previously investigated by time - resolved photoluminescence ( pl)@xcite or pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite . however , due to the low temporal resolution in refs . and/or \n to the lack of selectivity in refs . , these studies were not able to unambiguously distinguish all the scattering ( spin and valley ) relaxation channels in mos@xmath0 , and to decouple the _ \n e _ and _ h _ dynamics .    \n here we determine the individual characteristic relaxation times of charge , spin and valley - associated crystal momentum in a 1l - mos@xmath0 . \n we find that the _ h _ spin / valley relaxation time is over an order of magnitude larger than for _ \n e_. this stems from the fact that _ e _ can exchange spin and valley degrees of freedom independently , while _ \n h _ have to undergo a scattering event where spin _ and _ valley need to be _ simultaneously _ transferred to the lattice . \n our results demonstrate that coupling valley and spin in high spin - orbit materials is a promising strategy towards the realization of robust spintronic / valleytronic platforms , where information associated with spin / valley degrees of freedom can thus survive for a longer time .    to investigate the 1l - mos@xmath0 spin and valley dynamics , we must separately access , for both _ \n e _ and _ h _ , the spin relaxation processes occurring within the same valley and those involving intervalley scattering . \n to do so , we combine two complementary ultrafast optical spectroscopy techniques : time - resolved circular dichroism ( trcd)@xcite ( see caption of fig.[fig1]b for an outline of this technique ) and time - resolved faraday rotation ( trfr)@xcite ( see caption of fig.[fig1]b for an outline of this technique ) . \n we find that _ e _ relaxation , involving both spin - flip and inter - valley scattering , occurs on a short time ( @xmath8200 fs ) , whereas _ h _ inter - valley scattering acts on longer time scales@xmath85ps . \n this indicates that the non - equilibrium dynamics in 1l - mos@xmath0 , including the recombination processes , is dominated by _ \n h _ scattering .    \n a 1l - mos@xmath0 flake ( @xmath9m@xmath10 m , see methods ) is mechanically exfoliated from bulk mos@xmath0 , identified and characterized by optical contrast , pl and raman measurements , and then transferred on a fused silica substrate ( see methods ) . \n the use of a metal frame , as explained in methods , allows us to locate the same flake for both trcd and trfr measurements .    in trcd experiments \n the system is excited by a circularly polarized pump beam , while the transient transmittivity is probed by a co- and a counter - circularly polarized broadband probe beam . in the case of mos@xmath0 , \n the pump - induced spin and valley dynamics is given by the difference of the transient signals measured in the two configurations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transient variation of the transmittivity measured with pump and probe pulses having the same ( opposite ) helicity ( see fig.[fig1]b and methods ) . \n trcd measurements are performed at 77k to reduce the _ \n e_-_h _ spin scattering rate , which generally increases when room temperature is approached@xcite . the wavelength of the circularly polarized narrow - band pump pulse is tuned to 650 nm ( i.e. close to the direct gap optical transition measured at 77k@xcite ) while the probe pulse covers a broad wavelength range between 500 and 700 nm ( see methods ) . \n the transient optical response is dominated by the a and b excitonic transitions across * k * , centered respectively at@xmath8655 and 605 nm , corresponding to the creation of an _ \n e_-_h _ pair with _ \n e _ in the cb minimum and _ h _ either in the vb maximum ( a ) or in the split - off band ( b)@xcite . we observe a vanishing trcd signal associated with b ( fig.[fig2]c ) , while a shows a trcd dynamics characterized by a bi - exponential decay ( fig.[fig2]b ; 655 nm probe ) . \n such behavior mirrors the different time - evolution of the spin - resolved bleaching of the direct optical transitions at * k , k * , respectively , and can be exploited to investigate the time evolution of _ e_/_h _ spin relaxation @xcite . \n in fact , in a , bleaching can occur only when the probe pulse has the same helicity as the pump , at least as long as photoexcited _ \n e_/_h _ maintain their original spin and valley degrees of freedom@xcite . \n the trcd relaxation dynamics is thus determined by four processes ( fig.[fig2]b ) : ( i ) _ h _ inter - valley scattering at the vb maximum ; ( ii ) _ e _ inter - valley scattering and ( iii ) intra - valley spin flip at the cb minimum ; ( iv ) _ \n e_-_h _ recombination . \n note that spin - orbit coupling prohibits intra -

mentioned mechanisms affecting the _ e_/_h _ dynamics are indistinguishable from the point of view of trcd and can be described by an effective relaxation time @xmath25fs for _ e _ and @xmath26ps for _ h _ , @xmath27 being the time constant of the _ e _ intra - valley ( spin flip ) relaxation , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) the characteristic time of the inter - valley _ \n e _ \n ( _ h _ ) scattering , and @xmath30 the _ e _ ( _ h _ ) radiative and non - radiative recombination time . \n the value of @xmath31 is in agreement with the spin / valley decay time ( @xmath32  ps ) measured by time - resolved pl @xcite , which sets a lower limit for the _ e_/_h _ \n recombination time . \n this reveals that recombination does not affect the _ e _ dynamics , which is dominated by fast intra- and inter - valley scattering , and that polarized pl is given by the radiative recombination between unpolarized _ e _ and almost fully - polarized _ \n h_.    \n we further investigate the inter- and intra - valley dynamics governing the non - equilibrium response of 1l - mos@xmath0 with trfr , where a left ( right)-circularly polarized pump pulse , resonant with the a exciton , creates a spin- and valley - polarized density of _ e_/_h _ with non - vanishing and well - defined orbital angular momentum . \n a delayed linearly polarized probe beam is transmitted through the sample , subsequently separated through a wollaston prism into two orthogonal linearly - polarized beams and equally distributed on two balanced photodiodes . \n the transient dynamics associated with the orbital momentum of the photoexcited charges is probed by measuring the rotation angle @xmath33 of a linearly polarized probe pulse , which manifests itself as a difference between the signals measured by the two photodiodes ( fig.[fig1]c ) . \n because of the direct gap transition at the two degenerate valleys , the trfr signal in mos@xmath0 is affected both by pauli blocking , inhibiting the absorption of light having the same circular polarization of the pump , and by helicity - dependent light scattering from the photoexcited _ e_/_h _ populations . \n the first phenomenon is similar to that governing trcd : _ \n e_/_h _ populations with well - defined spin and valley degrees of freedom reduce the absorption of probe light with the same circular polarization as the pump . \n therefore , the imaginary part of the transient refractive index assumes different values for opposite light helicities . \n since the real and imaginary part of the refractive index are related by the kramers - kronig transformations@xcite , the system displays asymmetric values of the phase accumulated by left- and right - circularly polarized light crossing the sample , resulting in the rotation of the polarization plane of the linearly polarized probe light . \n this process , however , is active only when the probe light is resonant with electronic transitions across the gap . in order to rule out this effect \n , we perform a two - color trfr experiment in which the probe energy is deliberately tuned below the absorption edge ( @xmath34=700 nm ) as shown in fig.[fig2]c .     \n a ) trfr traces measured by exciting the sample with left and right circularly - polarized pump pulses ( red and blue curves , respectively ) and a linearly polarized pump pulse ( gray curve ) . \n excitation is centered at 650 nm and the probe at 700 nm . all the traces are measured at 77k . \n the inset shows the temporal evolution of @xmath35 in semi logarithmic scale in order to emphasize the bi - exponential character of the decay rate . \n the black solid line represents the analytical fit of the data to the rate equations . \n the decay constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to the intervalley scattering of _ e _ and _ h _ , respectively . \n these processes are accompanied by an exchange of crystal momentum and are sketched in b).,width=302 ]    fig.[fig3]a plots the dynamics of the faraday rotation , @xmath35 , measured at 77 k by exciting spin polarized charges in either the * k * or the * k * valley with a circularly polarized pump pulse . \n the change of sign of the signal with excitation helicity is due to the valley selectivity of the near gap resonant transitions . \n as expected , trfr performed with a linearly polarized pump pulse ( gray curve ) gives rise to a negligible signal because both valleys are equally populated .    \n as far as electric dipole transitions are concerned , photons do not couple with the spin of the charges but only with their orbital degree of freedom @xcite . \n thus , the faraday rotation associated with the scattering of light by the photoexcited charges can only derive from an unbalanced distribution of their orbital angular momentum projections . \n as shown in fig.[fig3]b , the orbital momentum of both _ \n e _ and _ h _ is associated with the valley degree of freedom , therefore the trfr experiment is sensitive exclusively to inter - valley and recombination dynamics , and it can not be influenced by intra - valley transitions in the cb minimum .    \n we now analyze the trfr dynamics using the rate equations for the photoexcited @xmath36 and @xmath37 densities in the * k*(*k * ) valley ( see methods ) . \n the trfr trace is then given by @xmath38-\\left[a_{e}e_{k'}(t)+a_{h}h_{k'}(t)\\right]$ ] where @xmath39 are two fitting coefficients , taking into account the different weights of spin - oriented _ e _ and _ h _ ( see methods ) . \n as shown in the inset of fig.[fig3]a , @xmath35 relaxes with two different time scales . \n we attribute the faster one to _ e _ inter - valley scattering , with a decay time @xmath40 fs , while we assign the slower one to _ \n h _ \n relaxation with @xmath41 ps , in excellent agreement with the trcd results . with a reliable estimation for @xmath28 and \n considering that the recombination process are markedly slower than all the other _ e _ relaxation processes ( i.e. @xmath42 ) , we can now extrapolate from the trcd data the characteristic time constant for intra - valley _ \n e _ spin - flip transitions , obtaining @xmath43 fs at 77 k , comparable to @xmath28 .        \n we then study the temperature dependence of the trfr dynamics ( figs.[fig4]a , b , c ) . \n we ascribe the observed decrease of @xmath28 and @xmath31 with temperature to the increase of the momentum scattering rate by phonons . \n the pump fluence dependence of @xmath35 is also investigated in figs.[fig4]d , e , f . both decay constants ( @xmath28 and @xmath31 ) decrease exponentially for an increasing density of photoinduced charges , contrary to the case of 1l - wse@xmath0 , where it was shown that exciton - exciton interaction does not affect the spin relaxation time@xcite . \n we attribute this behavior to the exchange interaction acting on the _ e_/_h _ populations , which increases with pump fluence . \n we extrapolate the value of @xmath29 from @xmath31 for @xmath44 0 , obtaining @xmath45 ps .    in conclusion \n , we determined the inter - valley and intra - valley scattering dynamics of optically injected spin - oriented charges in 1l - mos@xmath0 by combining two complementary techniques , trcd and trfr . \n we found that the characteristic time scales of spin - flip and inter - valley scattering for electrons are both@xmath46fs , whereas hole inter - valley scattering acts on a time scale@xmath47ps . \n the large stabilization of spin / valley degrees of freedom resulting from the coupling between spin and valley dynamics paves the way to the integration of materials with large spin - orbit in robust spintronic / valleytronic platforms . \n furthermore , the procedure described here is of general validity and can be applied to study _ \n e_/_h _ intra and intervalley scattering processes in any other monolayer tmd .    \n we acknowledge funding from nanofacility piemonte , erc synergy hetero2d , graphene flagship ( n. 604391 ) , a royal society wolfson research merit award , epsrc grants ep / k01711x/1 , ep / k017144/1 , ep / l016087/1 , grant n. 20130615 ( fondazione cariplo ) , futuro in ricerca grant no . \n rbfr12sw0j of the italian ministry of education , university and research and search -

called ompf ionic channel found in the outer membrane of _ \n e. coli_. this is a relatively wide ionic channel in the sense that it allows the simultaneous permeation of both cations and anions ( in _ hydrated _ form ) at high rates . \n this channel is made of three identical monomerical nanopores ( see figure [ fig : snapshot ] ) , each one leaving an hourglass - shaped aqueous pore with a diameter between 1 - 4 nm surrounded by many charged titratable residues with an overall negative charge @xcite at @xmath5h=7 . in presence of monovalent electrolyte , it has a slight cationic selectivity ( i.e. the flux of cations is larger than the flux of anions across the pore ) which is well understood from basic electrostatic concepts @xcite . \n unexpected experimental results@xcite show that the cationic selectivity of the channel found for 1:1 electrolytes is reversed for sufficiently high concentrations of 2:1 or 3:1 electrolytes . \n the different divalent cations ( mg@xmath6 , ca@xmath6 , ba@xmath6 , ni@xmath6 ) give almost identical results , whereas trivalent cations ( la@xmath7 ) induce a substantially larger effect . \n another interesting piece of evidence is provided by x - ray@xcite data obtained from crystalls of ompf protein channels in 1 m of mgcl@xmath8 . in this structure , \n hydrated mg@xmath6 ions were found in contact with certain negatively charged residues , suggesting a strong cation - interfacial group interaction . \n all this evidence ( strong dependence on valency but small dependence on the particular cation , strong role of particular chemical groups ) suggests the existence of important ion - interfacial group correlations of electrostatic origin in this system .    in order to identify the basic physical mechanism underlying the observed selectivity inversion , we have performed all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with namd2 @xcite of the ompf channel in different electrolytes ( see fig.[fig : snapshot ] ) . in order to study the transport properties of the channel \n , we have applied an external electric field of @xmath9 mv / nm perpendicular to the lipid bilayer , which creates an electrostatic potential drop of @xmath10 mv across the membrane+channel system ( see supporting online material ) . \n this value of the potential drop was selected in order to be high enough to ensure ion permeation across the channel during the simulation and also because it is experimentally accessible . \n it has to be stressed that full - atomistic md simulations of transport in protein channels are extremely challenging , becoming possible only due to recent improvements in algorithms and computer power @xcite . in this case \n , we have conducted the first simulations of ionic transport in a protein channel in divalent electrolyte , which extraordinarily increases the need for longer simulation times and larger simulation systems , as discussed in detail in ref @xcite . \n all simulation details , algorithms , processing of the data and simulation movies can be found in the online supplementary information @xcite .    \n .ionic fluxes ( number of ions observed to cross the ompf channel during production runs of duration @xmath11 ) and occupancy numbers ( defined as number of ions of each species inside the protein channel averaged over the simulation runs , statistical errors in the mean are estimated from @xmath12 ) . \n the results correspond to simulations in three different conditions : 1 m kcl , 1 m mgcl@xmath8 and a mixture of 1 m mgcl@xmath8 and 1 m kcl . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     further insight on the physical basis of this inversion phenomenon can be obtained by analyzing the effect of adding a high amount of screening monovalent salt to a situation with inverted selectivity . \n the two different kinds of ionic correlations illustrated in figure [ correlations ] behave in opposite ways under the addition of high amounts of background monovalent electrolyte . \n experiments in silica nanochannels found selectivity inversion@xcite in presence of mgcl@xmath8 but the original selectivity of the channel is recovered@xcite ( no inversion ) in mixtures of multivalent electrolyte and kcl . \n this finding is in agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite based on ion - ion correlations between multivalent ions near strongly charged interfaces ( see figure [ correlations]a ) . on the other hand \n , theories predict that the short range electrostatic correlations between multivalent ions and interfacial groups ( see figure [ correlations]b ) are essentially not affected by the addition of 1:1 electrolyte . in this case \n , one expects that the original selectivity is not recovered after the addition of 1:1 salt ; rather one may expect to observe a _ weakened _ inverted selectivity . \n actually , this is what we observe in our simulations of the ion channel bathed by a mixture of 1 m kcl and 1 m mgcl@xmath8 ( see table [ table : fions ] ) . \n the strong transversal correlations between mg@xmath6 cations and acidic groups are also observed , with a similar intensity to that observed in the previous case with only mgcl@xmath8 ( see table [ table : binding ] and the isodensity figure available as online supporting material).the observed anionic current is larger than the cationic current : the initial cationic selectivity of the channel is not recovered . \n the cationic current obtained with 1 m of mgcl@xmath8 and 1 m of kcl is _ significantly smaller _ than that obtained in presence of only 1 m of kcl . \n also , both the occupancy number and flux of cl@xmath13 observed in this case are close to the values observed in the case with only kcl , in spite of having 3 times more anions in the electrolyte solution ( see table [ table : fions ] ) . \n hence , we can say that selectivity effects are weakened by the addition of 1:1 salt ( thus demonstrating their electrostatic origin ) but the inversion of selectivity has not been suppressed by adding 1:1 salt . \n this different response to added 1:1 electrolyte between our system and silica nanochannels emphasizes the different nature of the ionic correlations found in each case .    \n overall , our calculations provide a strong evidence showing the role played by electrostatic correlations in the selectivity of ionic transport in a wide biological nanochannel . in the view of recent nanotechnological applications of biological nanochannels and their engineered versions ( modified by directed mutagenesis ) \n @xcite it is tempting to suggest that our results may have also implications in the design of responsive channels for biotechnological applications . from the point of view of biophysics , it is also interesting to note that recent electrophoretic results in phospholipid vesicles @xcite also show a complex behavior in presence of multivalent ions which is robust against addition of 1:1 electrolyte . \n all these evidences suggest that biologically relevant molecules ( lipids or proteins ) have mechanisms to preserve a strong interaction with multivalent ions even in presence of physiologically amounts of screening salt .

in other words , the metric tensor ( and ultimately the curvature ) depends on the coordinate of the particle of interest @xmath96 , as well as from all other particles in the system , @xmath97 , with @xmath98 . \n the space curvature generated by the quantum potential evolve according to eq .   and , \n therefore , the wave - like nature of quantum mechanics is confined to the geometric description of the space and voided from any mechanical property ; all quantum effects are now absorbed into the metric of the configuration space .    _ \n relation to the schrdinger dynamics . _ an ensemble of trajectories following the dynamics in eq .   with properly chosen initial conditions describes the wavefunction dynamics of the time - dependent se . \n in fact , when projected back to the @xmath99 dimensional configuration space the trajectories defined in eq .   \n reproduce exactly the bohmian trajectories . \n this is evident from the correspondence of the characteristics associated to eq .   with the bohmian trajectories tangent to the vector field in eq .  \n therefore , when the initial configurations are sampled according to a given initial wavefunction density @xmath100 , the geodesics ( or the corresponding bohmian trajectories ) evolve these points such that at a later time their density , @xmath101 , is consistent with the time - propagated wavefunction @xmath53 .    _ application . \n i illustrate the implications of the dynamics described in the proposition by means of a simple example : the scattering of a gaussian wavepacket with an eckart - type potential barrier in one dimension ( fig .  \n [ fig1 ] ) . \n this problem is described in details in  @xcite . in this case \n , the finsler s space is described by an extended @xmath102 dimensional phase space with coordinates @xmath103 , while the progress of the dynamics is measured by the parameter @xmath77 . \n the wavepacket , @xmath104 ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) is initialised at position @xmath107 , while the potential , @xmath108 , is fixed and centered at @xmath109 . \n all quantities are given in atomic units ( a.u . ) , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . \n an ensemble of 200 trajectories is used to describe the wavepacket dynamics . \n they are initially distributed according the the probability @xmath112 , while @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for all trajectories . \n the time evolution of the wavepacket is depicted in fig .  \n [ fig1 ] together with the corresponding snapshots of the quantum potential computed on the support of the wavepacket ( inset of the upper panel ) , which is given by the values @xmath116 sampled by the 200 trajectories at a given value of @xmath77 ( or time @xmath117 ) .     \n ( dark brown ) and @xmath118 ( light brown ) in intervals of @xmath119 . \n the inset shows the dynamics of the quantum potential in the same time interval . \n lower panel : time evolution of the space curvature @xmath120 projected along the space coordinate @xmath116 ( same color code as for the upper panel ) . \n the static classical potential ( eckart barrier ) is show in gray . \n all quantities are measured in atomic units.,width=8 ]    the space curvature is defined as ( @xmath121 ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the ricci tensor and @xmath124 is the riemann curvature tensor with @xmath125 . \n the lower panel of fig .  \n [ fig1 ] shows the value of the curvature , @xmath126 , on the support of the wavepacket , sampled by the trajectories labeled with @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , at different values of @xmath129 ranging from @xmath130 to @xmath118 in intervals of @xmath119 . \n initially ( @xmath131 ) , the curvature is positive for all points ( dark brown lines ) , while at later times we observe regions of positive and negative curvature . towards the end of the simulation \n the curvature become strongly negative for all points at the right - hand side of the potential barrier .    \n this becomes more evident if we observe the dynamics in the plane defined by the coordinates @xmath132 and @xmath133 . \n fig .  \n [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the system as a series of _ line fronts _ in the @xmath132 , @xmath133 plane ;

in fact , like in bohmian mechanics  @xcite , the trajectories describe deterministic paths in space and the transition to the classical world does not require the concept of wavefunction collapse . \n the wavefunction character of the quantum state and its dynamics is now confined to the characterization of the curvature of the configuration space of each constituent particle , while the system evolves along deterministic geodesic curves . \n finally , the geometrization of quantum mechanics offers a clear opportunity for the unification with einstein s theory of general relativity .      \n the author acknowledges giovanni ciccotti for useful discussions .

size ] . \n the calculated results indicate that the core size is @xmath82  fm when the experimental @xmath2 data of @xmath1al is reproduced ( 8@xmath97% larger than the size of the bare @xmath8 mg nucleus ) .    in order to reproduce the @xmath2 of @xmath1al from the current work , a larger sized core is deduced within the framework of the spherical glauber model . \n it should be pointed out that this enlarged core may not necessarily reflect increased physical size of the nucleus . \n the negligence of some specific effects in the glauber model could lead to the larger sized core . \n the possible reasons for the enlargement will be discussed qualitatively below . \n the effect of quadrupole deformation ( @xmath77 , the parameter describing the deformation ) on the rms radius can be expressed as @xmath83  @xcite . as shown in the inset of fig .  \n [ core - size ] , @xmath76 of the core changes quickly with the increase of @xmath77 . \n this simple relationship between @xmath76 and @xmath77 indicates that a deformed core inside @xmath1al will give a larger sized @xmath8 mg . in order to reproduce the @xmath2 of @xmath1al , \n the lower limit of @xmath76 for the core is 2.95 fm as we can see from the calculated results in the figure . \n if we assume that the shape of @xmath8 mg as a nucleus is spherical and enlargement of the core is due to deformation , the lower limit of @xmath84 for the core could be deduced from the inset of fig .  \n [ core - size ] . \n deformation of @xmath85 will give around 8@xmath86 larger radius for the @xmath8 mg core . \n the experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated the deformation for @xmath8 mg . \n the experimental @xmath77 is 0.566  @xcite , the calculated @xmath77 by rmf and generalized hybrid derivative coupling model are around 0.4 and 0.6 , respectively  @xcite . \n if the bare nucleus @xmath8 mg is deformed , the above analysis indicates that @xmath8 mg as a core in @xmath1al may have larger deformation as compared with @xmath8 mg as a nucleus . additionally , the first excited state of @xmath8 mg was calculated within the rmf framework and its @xmath76 is obtained to be around 2.4% larger than that of the ground state  @xcite . thus the core excitation effect may also contribute to the larger size for @xmath8 mg . as demonstrated by the shell model calculations , the configuration of @xmath8 mg ( ground state ) plus a @xmath10-wave proton is dominant in @xmath1al  \n @xcite . if deformation and excitation effects exist in the core , the first one may be the main component .    in summary , \n the longitudinal momentum distribution of fragments after one - proton removal for @xmath1al and reaction cross sections for @xmath3al were measured . \n an enhancement was observed for the @xmath2 of @xmath1al . \n the @xmath0 distributions were found to be wide and consistent with the goldhaber model s prediction . \n the experimental @xmath0 and @xmath2 results were discussed within framework of the few - body glauber model . \n we determined the valence proton to be a dominant @xmath10-wave configuration in the ground state of @xmath1al . \n it indicates no halo structure in this nucleus . but \n a larger sized @xmath8 mg core was deduced in order to explain both the @xmath2 and @xmath0 distributions within framework of the spherical few - body glauber model . \n it is pointed out that deformation and core excitation effects may be two main reasons for the extracted larger sized core . \n further theoretical investigations are needed to extract more specific structure information for @xmath1al from the experimental data .

{"id": 870, "abstract": " by many - body quantum - chemical calculations , we investigate the role of two structural effects  local ligand distortions and the anisotropic cd - ion coordination  on the magnetic state of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , a spin @xmath2 pyrochlore . \n we find that these effects strongly compete , rendering the magnetic interactions and ordering crucially depend on these geometrical features . without trigonal distortions a large easy - plane magnetic anisotropy develops . \n their presence , however , reverses the sign of the zero - field splitting and causes a large easy - axis anisotropy ( @xmath3 mev ) , which in conjunction with the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( @xmath4 mev ) stabilizes an all -

matter physics and materials science . \n the few different structural varieties displaying ir ions in octahedral coordination and tetravalent @xmath6 valence states , in particular , have set the playground for new insights into the interplay between strong spin - orbit interactions and electron correlation effects @xcite . equally intriguing but \n less investigated are pentavalent os @xmath7 oxides such as the pyrochlore cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and the perovskite naoso@xmath8 @xcite . \n just as for the iridates , major open questions with respect to the osmates are the mechanism of the metal to insulator transition ( mit ) and the nature of the low - temperature antiferromagnetic ( af ) configuration . while initially a slater type picture has been proposed for the mits in both cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and naoso@xmath8 @xcite , alternative scenarios such as a lifshitz transition in the presence of sizeable electron - electron interactions \n have been suggested as well very recently @xcite .    \n so far theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of the os @xmath7 oxides have been carried out only as mean - field ground - state ( gs ) calculations within the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite or the lda+@xmath9 model @xcite . here , \n we report results of many - body quantum - chemical calculations for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 . \n we describe the local os @xmath10 multiplet structure , the precise mechanism of 2nd - order spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and zero - field splitting ( zfs ) , and determine the parameters of the effective spin hamiltonian , i.e. , the single - ion anisotropy ( sia ) , nearest - neighbor ( nn ) heisenberg exchange as well as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions . \n the results indicate that basic electronic - structure parameters such as the sia crucially depend on geometrical details concerning both the o and adjacent cd ions . \n in particular , the anisotropic cd - ion coordination lifts the degeneracy of the os @xmath11 levels even in the absence of o - ion trigonal distortions and yields large zfss and easy - plane magnetic anisotropy . a configuration with trigonally distorted o \n octahedra is however energetically more favorable , changes the sign of the zfs , and thus gives rise to easy - axis anisotropy at the os sites , which in conjunction with the af nn exchange stabilizes the so - called all - in / all - out spin order . \n the competition between the two structural effects is a generic feature in 227 pyrochlores and opens new perspectives on the basic magnetism in these materials .    \n os@xmath0o@xmath1 ( red arrows ) involving the o ligands ( in beige ) around each os site ( blue ) and ( ii ) the hexagonal cd - ion ( green ) coordination . \n the clusters used in the calculation of the zfss also include the six nn octahedra , see text . ]    _ os @xmath10 electron configuration , single - ion physics . _ to investigate in detail the os @xmath12-level electronic structure , multiconfiguration self - consistent - field ( mcscf ) and multireference configuration - interaction ( mrci ) calculations @xcite were first performed on embedded clusters made of one reference oso@xmath13 octahedron , six adjacent cd sites , and six nn oso@xmath13 octahedra . \n the farther solid - state environment was modeled as an one - electron effective potential which in a ionic picture reproduces the madelung field in the cluster region . \n all calculations were performed with the molpro quantum - chemical software @xcite . \n we employed energy - consistent relativistic pseudopotentials for os @xcite and cd @xcite and gaussian - type valence basis functions from the molpro library ( see supplementary material @xcite ) .    from simple considerations based on crystal - field ( cf ) \n theory , the orbital gs for a @xmath10 ion in octahedral coordination is singlet . \n thus , neglecting soc , the lowest electron configuration should be @xmath14(@xmath15 ) . \n this is indeed found in the quantum - chemical calculations if soc is not included . \n the components of the spin - quartet @xmath16 gs can interact , however , via soc with higher lying @xmath17 terms and for noncubic axial systems split into two kramers doublets , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively @xcite . \n the @xmath17 states are themselves split in noncubic cfs . in the recent work of matsuda _ \n et al . _  \n @xcite , for instance , the interaction of the @xmath14 and lowest @xmath20 states was analyzed . \n the _ ab initio _ quantum - chemical calculations yield , nevertheless , a rather large @xmath14@xmath20 excitation energy , 5.4 ev by mcscf calculations including in the active orbital space all @xmath5 functions at the central os site and the @xmath11 orbitals of the six os nns , which is not surprising in fact for extended @xmath5 orbitals that feel very effectively the o @xmath21 charge distribution . \n additionally , the _ ab initio _ investigation actually shows that the excited @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath15 doublets occur at much lower energies , 1 to 2.5 ev ( see table  [ dd_actual ] ) , and the zfs of the @xmath14 levels is mainly related to the interaction with those states . to make the mrci calculations feasible and the analysis of the results limpid , we further replaced the six os@xmath24 @xmath10 nns by closed - shell ta@xmath24 @xmath25 species . \n we checked , for example , that the @xmath5 charge distribution and the @xmath11@xmath26 splitting at the central os site are not affected by this substitution . in the mrci computations \n , we included on top of the mcscf wave functions all single and double excitations from the os @xmath5 and o @xmath21 orbitals at the central octahedron . \n the reference multiconfiguration active space is given by five @xmath5 orbitals at the central os site and three electrons and the results are listed in table  [ dd_actual ] .    \n lll @xmath7 splittings & mrci & mrci+soc ( @xmath27 ) +   + @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) & 0.00 & 0.00 ; @xmath28 + @xmath29 ( @xmath15 ) & 1.51 ; 1.51 & 1.40 ; 1.53 + @xmath30 ( @xmath15 ) & 1.61 ; 1.62 ; 1.62 & 1.63 ; 1.66 ; 1.76 + @xmath31 ( @xmath15 ) & 1.46 ; 2.49 ; 2.49 & 2.63 ; 2.76 ; 2.87 + @xmath20 ( @xmath32 ) & 5.08 ; 5.20 ; 5.20 & 5.14 ; ... ; 5.45 + @xmath33 ( @xmath32 ) & 5.89 ; 6.01 ; 6.01 & 6.02 ; ... ; 6.33 + @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) & 10.29 ; 10.63 ; 10.63 & 10.41 ; ... ; 11.00 +    to extract the zfs , we compute the spin - orbit interaction matrix for the lowest four quartet and three doublet spin states , see table  [ dd_actual ] . \n the mrci+soc data of table  [ dd_actual ] show that the zfs of the @xmath14 gs is rather large , @xmath35 mev . \n this gives a first estimate of the splitting parameter @xmath36 mev , one to two orders of magnitude larger than for @xmath37 ions in standard coordination @xcite . \n however , for explicitly deriving the full sia tensor @xmath38 , we further employ the effective hamiltonian methodology described in ref .  \n @xcite . here , \n socs and the mixing of the @xmath14 components with higher lying cf excited states are treated as small perturbations and the spin - orbit wave functions related to the high - spin @xmath15 configuration are projected onto the space spanned by the @xmath14 @xmath39 states . using the orthonormalized projections @xmath40 of the low - lying @xmath16 quartet wave functions and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath41 we then construct the effective hamiltonian @xmath42 @xcite . \n the orthonormalization is done using the formalism introduced by des cloizeaux @xcite , i.e. , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the overlap matrix and @xmath45 are the projections of the wave functions onto the model space . \n a one - to - one correspondence can be now drawn between the matrix elements of @xmath46 and the model hamiltonian for the anisotropic single site problem , @xmath47 , to extract the zfs tensor ( for details , see supplementary material @xcite ) . \n diagonalizing the @xmath38 tensor we finally obtain on the basis of the _ ab initio _ quantum - chemical data an axial parameter @xmath48 mev , a rhombic parameter @xmath49 , and an univocally defined easy axis of magnetization along the @xmath50 $ ] direction , perpendicular to the plane of cd nns .    to gain deeper insight into the origin of the strong axial anisotropy , we performed additional calculations for an ideal pyrochlore structure with no trigonal distortions of the o octahedra . \n it turns out that the 227 pyrochlore lattice is fully defined by just three parameters : the space group , the cubic lattice constant @xmath51 , and the coordinate @xmath52 of the o at the @xmath53 site , denoted o(1 ) in ref .  \n @xcite . for @xmath54 , the oxygen cage around each os site \n forms an undistorted , regular octahedron @xcite . in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 , however , @xmath52 is slightly larger than @xmath55 @xcite , which translates into a compressive trigonal distortion of the oso@xmath13 octahedra . \n interestingly , for undistorted o octahedra ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) we still found @xmath57 and the same orientation of the magnetic @xmath58 axis . \n the axial parameter , however , changes its sign to @xmath59 mev . \n a positive @xmath60 indicates that the @xmath58 axis is now a hard axis . \n the basic mechanism responsible for this change of sign is apparent when comparing the os @xmath7 multiplet structure for the actual lattice ( table  [ dd_actual ] ) with that for a idealized crystal with no trigonal distortions ( table  [ dd_5.16 ] ) . \n in particular , the order of the split components of the @xmath30 states , i.e. , one singly - degenerate and one doubly - degenerate term , changes in table  [ dd_5.16 ] as compared to table  [ dd_actual ] , which modifies the interaction of the @xmath16 terms with the excited states .    \n lll @xmath7 splittings & mrci & mrci+soc ( @xmath27 ) +   + @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) & 0.00 & 0.00 ; @xmath61 + @xmath29 ( @xmath15 ) & 1.53 ; 1.53 & 1.43 ; 1.50 + @xmath30 ( @xmath15 ) & 1.61 ; 1.61 ; 1.63 & 1.64 ; 1.64 ; 1.75 + @xmath31 ( @xmath15 ) & 2.42 ; 2.45 ; 2.45 & 2.59 ; 2.75 ; 2.81 + @xmath20 ( @xmath32 ) & 5.34 ; 5.41 ; 5.41 & 5.36 ; ... ; 5.65 + @xmath33 ( @xmath32 ) & 6.13 ; 6.20 ; 6.20 & 6.23 ; ... ; 6.52 + @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) & 10.85 ; 10.98 ; 10.98 & 10.93 ; ... ; 11.38 +    we find in the mrci calculations a linear relation between @xmath60 and the distortion angle @xmath62 , see fig .  \n [ dtheta ] . \n the effect of a trigonal field alone on the energy levels and on the zfs of @xmath10 ions has been previously investigated in the framework of a simplified cf model and perturbation theory @xcite . \n a linear relation is also established in alum salts @xcite . \n in contrast to the model assumed in ref .  \n @xcite , however , we find that the @xmath63 line does not go through origin . \n this is due to the noncubic field generated by the cd nns , which form a highly anisotropic planar structure arround each os site . \n similar competing stuctural effects have been evidenced in ni@xmath64y@xmath65 molecular complexes @xcite . \n we also plot in fig .  \n [ dtheta ] the total - energy landscape as function of the distortion angle @xmath62 . \n it is seen that at the mrci level the minimum of the parabola corresponds to a trigonal compressive distortion @xmath66 for fixed os - o bond length , close to the experimental value of @xmath67 @xcite .    _ superexchange interactions . _ to investigate the nn magnetic couplings , we designed ten - octahedra embedded clusters . \n the analysis of the intersite interactions is here carried out for only two magnetically active os @xmath10 ions ( see fig . \n [ dm ] ) , while for simplicity the eight os@xmath24 nns were modeled as closed - shell ta@xmath24 @xmath25 ions . \n multiconfiguration wave functions were first generated by state - averaged mcscf optimizations for the lowest singlet , triplet , quintet , and septet states in the two - site problem . \n those configuration state functions give rise in the spin - orbit calculations to sixteen spin - orbit states . \n for each spin multiplicity the mcscf active space is defined by the set of six os @xmath11 orbitals accommodating a total number of six electrons . \n we then further accounted for single and double excitations from the os @xmath11 and bridging - o @xmath21 orbitals on top of the mcscf reference wave functions . \n such mrci calculations yield magnetic coupling constants in very good agreement with experimental data in the @xmath6 iridate sr@xmath0iro@xmath68 @xcite \n . similar strategies of explicitly dealing only with selected groups of localized ligand orbitals were adopted in earlier studies on @xmath37 compounds @xcite .     and ( b ) total energy of the cluster @xmath69 , as functions of the trigonal distortion angle @xmath62 , see text . \n mrci+soc results for clusters as that depicted in fig .  \n [ distortions ] . \n no trigonal distortions are applied within the embedding , i.e. , @xmath54 for the surrounding lattice . ]    from the calculations without socs , we see that the energy splittings between the different spin states follow the sequence @xmath70 , 3@xmath70 , 6@xmath70 and can be fitted to an af isotropic exchange model @xmath71 , with a mean squared error of @xmath72 mev . adding a biquadratic term @xmath73 improves the accuracy of the fit to @xmath74 mev and yields a first mrci estimate of @xmath75 mev . \n thus @xmath70 is of the same order of magnitude as the sia while @xmath76 mev .    \n _ antisymmetric exchange . \n _ anisotropic , non - heisenberg terms can be further obtained from spin - orbit calculations within the manifold defined by the lowest singlet , triplet , quintet , and septet spin states for two os @xmath10 sites . as expected , including socs does not bring significant corrections to the effective superexchange : @xmath70 is @xmath77 mev by mrci+soc calculations . \n the spin - orbit interactions , however , lift the degeneracy of the initial spin multiplets and brings in antisymmetric contributions . to describe the latter , \n we adopt a two - site model hamiltonian @xmath78 containing , in addition to the heisenberg and biquadratic terms , a dm antisymmetric exchange contribution @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a pseudovector with components @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . \n this model is then compared with the _ ab initio _ @xmath84 effective matrix @xmath85 derived from the mrci+soc calculations @xcite . \n we found perfect one - to - one correspondence between the two sets of matrix elements and could extract the numerical parameters @xmath86 , @xmath76 , and @xmath87 mev . according to these results \n , the dm vector is oriented along the @xmath88 axes ( see fig .  [ dm ] and ref .  \n @xcite ) and its norm is @xmath89 mev . \n the sense of the dm vector for a given os - os link , however , can not be determined from our _ ab intio _ data .     \n tetrahedra ( blue color ) in cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 . \n o ligands and nn cd ions around two adjacent os sites are shown in beige and green . \n the two possible orientations of the dm vector @xcite for two adjacent os ions is also shown , along with their respective easy axes . ]    _ discussion . \n _ whereas the absolute value of the mrci dm parameter is similar to estimates derived for certain values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath9 by lda+@xmath9 calculations @xcite , the superexchange @xmath70 and the sia @xmath60 turn out to be two ( @xmath70 ) to seven ( @xmath60 ) times smaller in our quantum - chemical study . \n it is known that quantum - chemical calculations based on either configuration - interaction techniques or 2nd - order perturbation theory are able to reproduce the experimentally derived @xmath70 coupling constants with an accuracy better than @xmath90 in insulating @xmath37-metal oxides , see , e.g. , refs .  \n @xcite and @xcite . for more extended @xmath5 electronic states in @xmath5-metal oxides , \n the hubbard @xmath9 is neither small nor large compared to the bandwidth , as corroborated from the mits @xcite and from constrained lda calculations @xcite . \n electron itineracy may therefore pose additional technical problems and limit the applicability of a finite cluster approach . \n it has been shown , however , that accurate @xmath70 s @xcite and @xmath12-@xmath12 excitation energies @xcite can be indeed computed for @xmath5 oxides such as the iridates . those findings in @xcite and @xcite indicate that approaching the essential physics in the @xmath5 oxides from a more localized perspective and within a finite - fragment framework certainly is a good starting point . additional potentially problematic points concern the size of the clusters , as discussed , e.g. , in ref .  \n @xcite . \n the clusters we employ here are , however , large enough to ensure an accurate description of both the charge distribution of nn octahedra around the `` active '' @xmath12 sites and the tails at those neighboring sites of wannier - like orbitals in the active region . \n as concerns the sia at @xmath12-metal sites in solids , extensive quantum - chemical investigations are missing . \n the present investigation therefore constitutes a step toward filling this gap .    \n the pure af heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice has an extensive number of classical gss which prevent any nel type ordering down to zero temperature @xcite . \n the easy - axis anisotropy lifts this macroscopic degeneracy and selects the so - called all - in / all - out ( or it s time reversed ) state , whereby all four spins sharing a given tetrahedron point toward or away from its center . \n this gs is selected irrespective of the relative strength of the anisotropy and af exchange energy @xcite . \n now , since the macroscopic gs degeneracy is already lifted by the sia , including the smaller dm interactions is not expected to drastically modify the physics of the system . in fact , if the sign of the @xmath80 vector is that of the direct type ( as defined by elhajal \n _ et al . _  \n @xcite ) , the dm interaction also favors the all - in / all - out state and thus does not compete with the sia . \n the competition arises for the opposite sign of the @xmath80 vector , labelled as indirect type in @xcite , where the dm couplings favor a continuous family of coplanar and non - coplanar gss @xcite .    \n _ conclusions . \n _ while trigonal distortions of the ligand cage are believed to open the door to topologically insulating states in @xmath91 227 iridate pyrochlores @xcite , we here show that the lattice degrees of freedom can fundamentally modify the nature of the magnetic interactions and ground states in @xmath5 227 compounds with larger magnetic moments . for this \n we employ _ ab initio _ multireference configuration - interaction methods , the results of which are further mapped onto model hamiltonians including both isotropic and anisotropic terms . \n to extract the dm couplings , we have expanded the formalism proposed earlier for @xmath92 cuprates @xcite . for the experimentally determined crystal structure of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite \n , we find an af superexchange coupling @xmath86 mev and easy - axis anisotropy of the same magnitude , @xmath48 mev , while the dm parameter is 3 to 4 times smaller . \n the dominant magnetic interactions , @xmath70 and @xmath60 , give rise to the all - in / all -

{"id": 900, "abstract": " a time - dependent model for the energy of a flaring solar active region is presented based on an existing stochastic jump - transition model @xcite . \n the magnetic free energy of an active region is assumed to vary in time due to a prescribed ( deterministic ) rate of energy input and prescribed ( random ) jumps downwards in energy due to flares . \n the existing model reproduces observed flare statistics , in particular flare frequency - size and waiting - time distributions , but modeling presented to date has considered only the time - independent choices of constant energy input and constant flare transition rates with a power - law distribution in energy . \n these choices may be appropriate for a solar active region producing a constant mean rate of flares . however , many solar active regions exhibit time variation in their flare productivity , as exemplified by noaa active region ar 11029 , observed during october - november 2009 @xcite . \n time variation is incorporated into the jump - transition model for two cases : 1 .  a step change in the rates of flare transitions ; and 2 .  a step change in the rate of energy supply to the system . \n analytic arguments are presented describing the qualitative behavior of the system in the two cases . in each case \n the system adjusts by shifting to a new stationary state over a relaxation time which is estimated analytically . \n the model exhibits flare - like event statistics . in each case \n the frequency - energy distribution is a power law for flare energies less than a time - dependent rollover set by the largest energy the system is likely to attain at a given time . \n the rollover is not observed if the mean free energy of the system is sufficiently large . for case  1 , \n the model exhibits a double exponential waiting - time distribution , corresponding to flaring at a constant mean rate during two intervals ( before and after the step change ) , if the average energy of the system is large . for case  2 \n the waiting - time distribution is a simple exponential , again provided the average energy of the system is large . \n monte carlo simulations of case  1 are presented which confirm the estimate for the relaxation time , and confirm the expected forms of the frequency - energy and waiting - time distributions . \n the simulation results provide a qualitative model for observed flare statistics in active region ar 11029 .

'' had thus been refined to inquiring about what happened when our universe was less than a second old . \n this included some particularly disturbing sub - questions . \n for instance , why is space so big , so old and so flat , when generic initial conditions predict the curvature to grow over time and the density to fast approach either zero or infinity ( the `` flatness problem '' ) ? what mechanism generated the @xmath4 level `` seed '' fluctuations ( visible as cosmic microwave background fluctuations in ) out of which all cosmic structure grew , and what conspiracy caused these fluctuations to have nearly identical amplitude in regions of space that had never been in causal contact ( the `` horizon problem '' ) ?      =    around when i started high school in 1982 , it was discovered that a process known as _ inflation _ , involving a nearly exponential stretching of space , could solve these and other problems in one fell swoop @xcite , and it soon emerged as the most popular theory for what happened very early on . \n inflation is simple and elegant , requiring merely the existence of some form of matter that stubbornly refuses to have its density diluted as space expands ( see @xcite for reviews ) . \n the cosmic density fluctuations are explained as the quantum fluctuations required by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , magnified by the stretching of space and amplified by gravity .    \n previous breakthroughs in theoretical physics like relativity theory and quantum mechanics not only solved old problems , but also transformed and deepened our understanding of the nature of physical reality . \n inflation did the same . \n first of all , it soon became clear that inflation is generically eternal @xcite , so that even though inflation has ended in the part of space that we inhabit ( ) , it still continues elsewhere and will ultimately produce an infinite number of other post - inflationary volumes as large as ours , forming a cosmic fractal of sorts .    \n moreover , as illustrated in , independent progress in theoretical physics has gradually shifted the borderline between `` laws of physics '' and `` initial conditions '' at the expense of the former . \n for example , a common feature of much string theory related model building is that there is a `` landscape '' of solutions , corresponding to spacetime configurations involving different dimensionality , different types of fundamental particles and different values for certain physical `` constants '' . as an example , table 1 lists the 30 parameters specifying the standard models of particle physics and cosmology , some or all of which may vary across the landscape . \n eternal inflation transforms such potentiality into reality , actually creating regions of space realizing each of these possibilities . however , each such region where inflation has ended is generically infinite in size , making it impossible for any inhabitants to travel to other regions where these apparent laws of physics are different .    table  1 : the 19 parameters of the @xmath5 standard model of particle physics , compiled from @xcite , followed by 11 cosmological parameters as compiled in @xcite . \n massive neutrinos require additional parameters . \n planck units are used , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined so that the higgs potential is @xmath8 .    [ \n cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we define parallel universes as regions that are for all practical purposes disconnected ( outside of causal contact for much longer than the lifetime of any observers ) , then these post - inflationary regions are an example thereof . \n they are labeled as  level ii \" in figure  , which is my attempt from @xcite to classify various types of parallel universes that have been discussed in the literature . \n since each such level 2 parallel universe is infinite in size , it consists of infinitely many spheres as in  this level i multiverse is much less diverse , with the only difference between the spheres being the initial matter distribution ( the initial conditions in the limited sense of classical physics  see ) . \n since the inflationary fluctuations are of quantum origin , inflation also populates the level iii multiverse ( if quantum mechanics is applicable to this multiverse as a whole ) . \n we will return to level iv below .    \n so how did it all begin ? \n although inflation gives a beautifully unified answer to the conundra of the 1970 s , we have seen that it still only refines the initial query further , leaving us with a number of questions :    1 .   \n how can we test whether inflation really happened ? 2 .   \n what is the physics underlying inflation ? \n ( what is this hard - to - dilute substance ? ) 3 .   \n why has inflation recently restarted ? \n ( what is the dark energy currently accelerating our universe ? ) 4 .   how did inflation begin ? \n or did it ?    \n thus addressing the question of how it all began is highly relevant also to other key questions in physics , such as the quest for the correct theory at the highest energies . \n probing inflation might offer our best hope to test string theory and other quantum gravity candidates , since the early universe is an unmanned physics experiment probing energy scales vastly exceeding those accessible in laboratories .

{"id": 949, "abstract": " we present and discuss the results of measurements of the @xmath0-plane resistivity of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 single crystals with small sr contents ( @xmath4 ) . \n the resistivity was obtained in the temperature range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by using an ac van der pauw technique . \n when the temperature is lowered , the @xmath7 curves show a transition from a linear behaviour to a semiconducting - like one . \n the deviation from the linearity occurs at a doping - dependent temperature @xmath8 . \n this effect can be interpreted as due to a progressive pinning of preexistent charge stripes . in the same framework , \n the appearance of anomalous sharp peaks in the @xmath7 curves of superconducting samples just above @xmath9 may be explained by a transition from a _ \n nematic _ to a more ordered _ \n smectic _ electronic stripe phase .    \n one of the most debated features of doped perovskites is the segregation of the charge carriers in one - dimensional domains , called stripes , observed both in some superconducting samples ( i.e. bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite ) and more recently in non - superconducting samples @xcite . \n this charge segregation is often invoked to explain the local survival of the antiferromagnetic order typical of the undoped compounds , but its correlation with the superconductivity is still a matter of discussion . in the last few years many papers treating this problem appeared in literature , stimulating the experimental search for unquestionable evidences of stripe ordering in high-@xmath9 cuprates .    referring in particular to la@xmath1sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 ( lsco ) and the related compound la@xmath14nd@xmath15sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 obtained by nd substitution , neutron diffraction and nqr experiments @xcite allowed to determine the temperatures of charge and spin ordering for various sr doping contents . in ref .  \n @xcite a signature of the charge ordering is identified in the deviation of the @xmath16 curve from the linearity which occurs at a temperature @xmath8 . in principle , each phase transition of the stripes involving a change in the transport properties should leave a mark on the resistivity . \n actually , if the metallic character of the stripes @xcite is accepted , they would be observable by means of resistivity measurements only when the amplitude of their fluctuations is sufficiently small on the measurement time scale , that is when they are at least partially localized or `` pinned '' @xcite . \n therefore , @xmath8 should be better referred to as a `` stripe localization '' temperature .    in the case of la@xmath17nd@xmath18sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 \n , it can be argued that the substitution of some la atoms with nd stabilizes the low - temperature tetragonal phase ( ltt ) , which favours the stripe pinning , instead of the low - temperature orthorhombic phase ( lto ) @xcite . \n therefore the occurrence of the lto @xmath19 ltt transition at about @xmath20 , besides leaving a clear kink on the resistivity curves , gives rise to the pinning of preexistent stripes making the @xmath16 curve acquire a semiconducting - like behaviour .    \n actually , a similar transition from a metallic - like to a semiconducting - like trend is also found in the @xmath0-plane resistivity of nd - free samples with sr contents @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . in these cases , however , a different stripe pinning mechanism is expected , due to the presence of impurities or to an intrinsic feature of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .    in this paper , we report the results of measurements of the @xmath0-plane resistivity @xmath7 of strongly underdoped lsco crystals ( ) between 4.2 and 300  k. the behaviour of the measured @xmath23 is then discussed in terms of three mechanisms following one another at the lowering of the temperature : stripe localization , stripe pinning and a possible stripe phase transition .    \n platelet - like lsco single crystals with mirror - like surfaces and typical size @xmath24 were grown by slowly cooling down a non - stoichiometric melt . \n the high quality of the crystals both from the superconductive and the crystallographic point of view was shown by ac susceptibility measurements and x - ray analysis . \n energy dispersion spectroscopy ( eds ) microprobe analysis was used to determine the resulting chemical composition of the samples , whose homogeneity was tested by comparing the results of `` single - point '' analyses made in different regions of each crystal .    \n the @xmath0-plane resistivity was obtained by using an ac version of the standard four - probe van der pauw technique . \n four good electrical contacts were obtained by evaporating au on the cleaved surface of each crystal , and then by submitting the samples to an annealing process at about @xmath25 for 10 min in air . \n thin gold wires were then soldered to the contacts by using ag conductive paint . \n two of the leads were used to inject into the samples alternating currents of @xmath26 at @xmath27 , while the remaining two were connected to a lock - in amplifier . \n the @xmath0-plane resistivity was obtained by suitably averaging the results of _ four _ resistance measurements .    \n fig .  \n [ f:1](a ) shows the resulting @xmath7 curves for samples with @xmath28 ( curve  _ a _ ) , 0.06 ( curve  _ b _ ) and 0.075 ( curve  _ c _ ) . crystals with @xmath28 do not undergo a superconducting transition ; instead , their resistivity shows a steep growth as the temperature is lowered , in a typical semiconducting - like fashion . \n however , an evident well - reproducible anomalous maximum followed by a dip is observed at a temperature of about @xmath29 . \n we reserve to give a detailed discussion of these features in a future paper .        \n [ f:1 ]    samples with @xmath30 and @xmath31 have instead a superconducting behaviour . \n the transition of the crystals with @xmath30 occurs at a critical temperature ( evaluated at the midpoint of the transition ) @xmath32 and has a broadening @xmath33 . for the crystals having @xmath31 the analogous quantities are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as shown more clearly in fig .  \n [ f:1](b ) , in both these cases the resistivity shows a sharp anomalous peak of width @xmath36 at a temperature @xmath37 about @xmath38 greater than the respective @xmath9 . \n incidentally , no anomalies are present in the ac susceptibility curves of the same samples .    before giving an interpretation to the observed behaviours of the @xmath0-plane resistivity curves , it is worthwhile to mention and confute some possible objections to the results obtained .    \n first , one could wonder if the peaks in curves _ b _ and _ c _ of fig .  [ f:1](b ) could be produced by some inaccuracy in the measurement or by an intrinsic systematic error due to the application of the van der pauw method . \n however , these curves are very reproducible and the experimental errors are not greater than the thickness of the lines . moreover , the anomalous peak is present and well recognizable in _ all _ the resistance vs. temperature curves ( with more than 2000 points each ) which have been averaged to obtain the @xmath0-plane resistivity as required by the van der pauw measurement technique , and therefore it is not likely to be an artifact introduced by inhomogeneities in the samples .    \n another possible objection is that the peaks in the curves _ b _ and _ c _ could be due to the contribution of semiconducting - like , non - superconducting regions of the sample . to check whether this is the case , \n we removed from the measured in - plane resistivity given by curves _ b _ and _ c _ of fig .  \n [ f:1](b ) the contribution of non - superconducting regions of different size , representing low - doping islands whose @xmath39 is given by curve  _ a _ of the same figure . \n the results reported in fig .  [ f:2](a ) for various non - superconducting volume percentage show that there s no way to cancel the anomalous peak above @xmath9 .        \n [ f:2 ]    finally , one could argue that a contribution of the @xmath40-axis resistivity @xmath41 ( which increases rapidly as @xmath42 ) could affect the measured @xmath23 giving rise to a peak such as that observed . \n actually , it is important to note that : i ) @xmath41 is , at low temperatures , about 8000 times @xmath23 @xcite ; ii ) because of the annealing process , the gold electrodes deeply penetrate into our samples , thus connecting several consecutive _ ab _ planes . \n if there were no inhomogeneities in the crystal , the current would only flow along these @xmath0 planes disregarding the _ \n c_-axis paths . \n consequently , a @xmath40-axis contribution is expected only in the presence of inhomogeneities in the @xmath0 planes . in order to analyze what happens in this case \n , we numerically calculated the equivalent resistance of a resistor network , in which each elementary cell represents the unit volume of the crystal ( with vertical and horizontal resistances numerically equal respectively to the measured @xmath41 and @xmath23 of our samples after the removal of the anomalous peak from @xmath23 ) , by assigning to a certain number of horizontal resistor the non - superconducting @xmath43 given by curve  _ a _ in fig  [ f:1](a ) . \n the results , shown in fig .  [ f:2](b ) for increasing non - superconducting volume percentage , indicate that the @xmath40-axis contribution can strongly modify the shape of the @xmath44 curve , but is unable to create very sharp peaks as those observed in our measurements .    \n we can now discuss in detail the results shown in fig  [ f:1](a ) and ( b ) . in the range \n the @xmath0-plane resistivity of all the crystals considered has an almost perfectly linear temperature dependence . \n we then perform a linear fit with a curve of the form which yields the best - fit parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 . with these values \n we calculate the normalized @xmath0-plane resistivity @xmath47 in the _ whole _ temperature range , from 4.2 up to 300@xmath48 . \n the resulting curves for the superconducting samples are plotted in fig .  \n [ f:3 ] .        \n [ f:3 ]    as previously anticipated , in a recent paper ichikawa _ \n et al . \n _ @xcite noted that the stripe localization temperature @xmath8 ( previously determined by nqr @xcite ) of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 single crystals with @xmath22 and @xmath49 marks the point at which the corresponding @xmath0-plane resistivity deviates from the high - temperature linear behaviour of an amount that depends on the sr concentration . \n in such a way , they defined threshold values for the deviation from linearity , which allow in principle to determine @xmath8 once known @xmath7 . supported by their work , we extrapolated the threshold vs. @xmath50 curve given in ref . \n @xcite to the sr contents of our interest : @xmath28 , 0.06 and 0.075 ( see the inset of fig .  [ f:3 ] ) . \n the extrapolation procedure is based on the fact that , for small @xmath50 , the threshold must tend to 1 and on a somehow arbitrary choice for the extrapolating function . by using b - spline functions we determined the smoothest curve that connects the straight line passing for the points deduced from ref . \n @xcite ( solid triangles in the inset of fig .  \n [ f:3 ] ) to the horizontal line of equation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the threshold value . to do so \n , we used as an additional point the intersection between these two straight lines , and we put to 1 the threshold at @xmath53 by using the fact that , for these doping contents , the material is an antiferromagnetic insulator . \n the thresholds determined in such a way for our sr concentrations are reported as open squares in the inset of fig .  \n [ f:3 ] together with the thresholds for nd - doped crystals reported in ref . \n @xcite ( solid squares ) . \n the point at which the normalized resistivity crosses the threshold determines the `` stripe localization '' temperature @xmath8 for each doping concentration . \n the crossing points for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are reported in the main graph of fig .  \n [ f:3 ] ( solid circles ) . \n the charge stripe localization temperatures @xmath8 are then plotted as a function of the sr content in fig .  \n [ f:4 ] ( solid squares ) together with the data ( open squares ) obtained by nqr measurements on la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystals with various doping contents @xcite . \n there s a _ very good agreement _ between the two data sets , which seems to indicate that the procedure described so far is essentially correct .    as shown in fig .  \n [ f:3 ] , when the temperature is lowered below @xmath8 the normalized @xmath23 increases , until the superconducting transition sets on . \n the upturn of the curve can be related to a progressive slowing down of the stripe fluctuations , i.e. to an increase of the pinning efficiency . \n actually , the problem arises of determining what is the mechanism responsible for the stripe pinning , since there is no nd substitution nor evidences of a structural lattice transition which would perhaps result in a kink in the @xmath23 . \n we propose that , in the strongly underdoped crystals we analyzed , the stripe pinning is `` intrinsic '' , in the sense that it is related to the very low density of doped holes ( @xmath54 holes per cu site ) .    \n let us now focus our attention on the narrow peaks observed in the superconducting samples ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) at @xmath37 ( solid triangles in fig .  \n [ f:4 ] ) just above @xmath9 ( open diamonds ) . \n a possible explanation for these anomalies could be the occurrence of a _ structural _ lattice transition , of the same kind of that observed in nd - substituted samples at higher temperature @xcite . \n actually , to our knowledge there are no other kinds of experiments supporting the occurrence of such a transition near @xmath9 in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . \n thus , we think these peaks could be due to an _ electronic _ transition to a more ordered stripe phase . \n this argument is based on ref .  \n @xcite , in which a detailed scenario of successive electronic phase transitions is depicted . \n as suggested by the schematic phase diagram reported there , a _ \n nematic _ to _ smectic _ phase transition just above the critical temperature is allowed in the case of underdoped ( but obviously superconducting ) copper - oxides . \n such a transition is not in conflict with the stripe localization argument exposed above . when the _ progressive _ intrinsic pinning of the stripes begins , it is possible that transverse stripe fluctuations are sufficiently violent to preserve the full translational invariance , destroying the rotational symmetry , as in the _ nematic _ stripe phase @xcite . at the lowering of the temperature , transverse fluctuations decrease and \n the stripes can undergo the transition to a _ \n smectic _ \n phase , or rather to a `` stripe glass '' , which is in fact a slightly disordered version of the smectic phase  @xcite .    \n the possibility of observing the mark of an electronic phase transition on the resistivity is also supported by experimental analogies with the behaviour of some metal dichalcogenides at the charge density wave transition @xcite . there , clear kinks very similar to the features present in our data were observed in the @xmath7 curves .        [ f:4 ]    the interpretation of the anomalous peaks at @xmath37 exposed above is also consistent with the coexistence of cluster spin - glass ( csg ) and superconductivity recently observed below  @xmath55 in lsco with @xmath30 @xcite . \n in fact , as predicted by the general theory of coupled order parameters , a spin order can appear only when the charge order is already well developed , i.e. at a lower temperature @xcite . \n the temperature of stripe ordering we determined here ( @xmath56 k ) is , as expected , greater than the temperature at which the csg phase appears ( @xmath57 ) .    in conclusion , we interpret the main features of the @xmath0-plane resistivity of strongly underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystals as a function of the temperature within the framework of the stripe phase transitions . \n we argue that the deviation from the linearity of the normalized @xmath7 curves allow obtaining the temperature of stripe localization @xmath8 . at the lowering of the temperature below @xmath8 \n , we hypothesize that an intrinsic stripe pinning mechanism due to the very low sr content of our samples becomes dominant giving rise to the upturn of the @xmath7 . \n finally , we propose to explain the anomalous narrow peaks above @xmath9 as due to a nematic to smectic electronic phase transition of the stripes .

therefore , the overlap between the modified pschl - teller potentials [ see eq . \n ( [ pt ] ) ] becomes smaller . \n consequently , two bound states originating from an independent modified pschl -

section lineshape observed by the besii collaboration  @xcite .    at the beginning \n , we assume that the production of @xmath1 in @xmath18 annihilation can be approximated by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) . \n this assumption means that the cross section for @xmath19 is dominated by intermediate vector meson productions via @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes any vector meson with an isospin of @xmath22 or @xmath23 . \n however , it is impossible to sum the contributions from all of the @xmath21 in reality . as a reasonable approximation \n , one can include the contributions from the vector mesons in the vicinity of the considered energy region but neglect those far off - shell vector mesons . in the energy region of the bes data from 3.74 gev to 3.8 gev , one can expect that @xmath2 plays the most important role among all of the @xmath21 , whereas the contributions from all the other @xmath21 can be treated as background . as shown in ref .  \n @xcite , the contribution from @xmath3 dominates the background , whereas the contributions from other states are negligible . \n therefore , we only include the contributions from the resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 and neglect those from the other resonances . \n namely , @xmath3 would be the main background near the @xmath4 threshold .    in vmd  @xcite \n , the coupling between the vector meson and a virtual photon can be described as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the vector meson field , @xmath26 is the photon field , and @xmath27 is the mass of the vector meson . setting the electron mass to @xmath28 , the coupling can be obtained as @xmath29^{1/2},\\label{efv}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the electron - position decay width of @xmath25 and @xmath31 is the fine - structure constant .    \n once the @xmath1 pair is produced from the decay of the vector meson @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the pair can undergo final - state interactions through the rescattering processes @xmath32 , which can be described by the effective field theory . in the energy region of interest , \n the three - vector momentum @xmath10 of the @xmath33 meson is small . \n thus , it is possible to construct an effective field theory for the low - energy @xmath1 interactions by making use of the expansion of the small momentum @xmath10 . because the mass of @xmath2 is just above the threshold of @xmath1 , we need to include @xmath2 explicitly in the formulation . near the threshold , the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) \n meson can be treated as nonrelativistic . \n thus , the interaction lagrangian for the @xmath1 system with the quantum number @xmath34 can be constructed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the field operator of @xmath2 ; @xmath14 ( @xmath37 ) annihilates a @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson ; @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) creates a @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson ; @xmath40 is the pauli matrix , and the ellipsis denotes other contact terms with more derivatives that are higher order terms . the first term in @xmath41 accounts for the interaction in the isospin singlet channel , and the second term accounts for the isospin triplet channel . \n the contributions from other resonances , which are not included in the lagrangian , can be saturated into the contact terms @xmath42 . \n therefore , we take the coefficients such as @xmath43 to be complex , where the imaginary parts of these terms come from the width of the saturated resonances and the @xmath17 annihilation effect . with isospin symmetry , we only have to consider the terms for the isospin singlet channel in @xmath42 to study the @xmath1 final - state interactions because the @xmath1 pair comes from the decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our approach .    . \n ( a ) @xmath44 , ( b ) contact interaction.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    now we come to the discussion of the power counting of this effective field theory . \n the tree - level diagrams for the @xmath1 elastic scattering are shown in fig .  [ tree ] . \n near the @xmath1 threshold , the denominator of the @xmath2 propagator can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath10 is the magnitude of the three - vector momentum of the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) meson in the overall center - of - mass frame , @xmath46 denotes the non-@xmath1 decay width of @xmath2 , and @xmath47 is the mass of @xmath2 . \n the @xmath1 decay width of @xmath2 will be included through the summation of the d meson loops in the following . because @xmath2 is close to the threshold of @xmath1 \n , we expect that @xmath48 is at @xmath49 . \n taking the momentum power of the @xmath50 vertex into account , we find that fig .  \n [ tree](a ) is at @xmath51 . from the naive power counting , \n the leading contact terms have two derivatives ; hence , these terms are at @xmath52 . however , in this naive power counting , we have assumed that the coefficients of the contact terms , i.e. , @xmath53 , are at order of @xmath51 . in some cases , especially when \n there are bound states or resonances near the threshold , the coefficients of the contact terms can be enhanced . \n for example , in a @xmath54 interaction , the s - wave contact terms @xmath55 scale as @xmath56@xcite . \n another example is the @xmath54 interaction in @xmath57 , where the leading contact term @xmath58 can be promoted to @xmath49@xcite . \n it is interesting to study whether the same enhancement mechanism takes place in the @xmath1 interactions because the resonance @xmath2 is located near the @xmath4 threshold . if @xmath59 is promoted to @xmath49 as @xmath58 in a @xmath54 interaction , then the corresponding tree diagram shown in fig .  \n [ tree](b ) is at @xmath51 , which is the same as fig .  \n [ tree](a ) . \n however , because we do not know the power of @xmath59 at the beginning , we then assume that the leading contributions to @xmath1 elastic scattering come from both fig .  \n [ tree](a ) and ( b ) . \n we will use the experiment data to determine @xmath59 and see whether this contact term is enhanced . \n accordingly , the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the specific channel ( @xmath60 ) can be obtained by summing the bubble diagrams as shown in fig .  \n [ bubble ] , which is equivalent to solving the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath61 with the @xmath1 potential truncated at the leading order .     \n interactions where the potential is truncated at the leading order.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    figure  [ feyndiagram ] illustrates the final - state interactions between the produced @xmath1 . because we first assume @xmath59 is enhanced , which indicates the interaction between @xmath62 is strong or the @xmath1 scattering length is large , we will use the power divergent substraction ( pds ) scheme proposed by ref .  \n @xcite to describe the large - scattering - length system in our calculations . \n the loop integrals that we will encounter in fig .  \n [ feyndiagram ] can generally be reduced to @xmath63\\cdot[e-\\ell^0-\\vec{\\ell}^2/2m_d+i\\epsilon]}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -i(\\mu/2)^{4-d}\\int\\frac{d^{(d-1)}\\ell}{(2\\pi)^{(d-1)}}\\frac{\\vec{\\ell}^2}{e-\\vec{\\ell}^2/m_d+i\\epsilon}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & im_d(m_d e)(-m_d e - i\\epsilon)^{(d-3)/2}\\gamma(\\frac{3-d}{2})\\frac{(\\mu/2)^{4-d}}{(4\\pi)^{(d-1)/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the total kinematic energy of the @xmath1 system . \n it is clear that this result is convergent in @xmath65 but divergent in @xmath66 . with the pds scheme \n , we have to remove the @xmath66 pole in the above result by adding the counterterm @xmath67 hence the subtracted integral in @xmath65 reads @xmath68 notice that @xmath69 at @xmath70 , which is simply the result in the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme . \n we can choose @xmath71 to be the typical momentum scale of the @xmath33 meson , which is @xmath72 mev in our calculations .    \n we can then write down the amplitude for @xmath19 as @xmath73    to be more specific , the amplitude for process fig .  \n [ feyndiagram](a ) reads @xmath74 with @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the dirac gamma matrix ; @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the incoming momenta of the electron and positron , respectively , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the outgoing momenta of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . \n @xmath81 can not be simply interpreted as the width of @xmath2 because this term is a complex number . if we set @xmath82 and @xmath70 , then @xmath83 .    the amplitude for fig .  \n [ feyndiagram](b ) can be written as @xmath84 with @xmath85^{-1},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pdg  @xcite value for the @xmath3 mass @xmath86 can be adopted , and @xmath87 can be extracted by eq .  \n ( [ efv ] ) using @xmath88 kev  @xcite .    to proceed , we denote the cross section for @xmath9 as @xmath89 , which does not include the initial state radiation ( isr ) effect . \n in reality , for a given energy @xmath90 , the actual c.m . \n energy for the @xmath18 annihilation is @xmath91 due to the isr effect , where @xmath92 is the total energy of the emitted photons . to order @xmath93 radiative correction in the @xmath18 annihilation , \n the observed cross section @xmath94 at besii can be related to our result @xmath95 through  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and the function @xmath98 is given by @xmath99.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     in our approach.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    before fitting the besii data with eq .  \n ( [ xsect - isr ] ) , we first discuss our treatment of @xmath100 . \n it seems impossible to determine @xmath100 definitely in our fitting because @xmath100 is always accompanied by @xmath59 in our formula , and any change of @xmath100 can be compensated by tuning @xmath59 . \n the experimental results on the non-@xmath1 branching ratio of @xmath2 decay are still controversial  @xcite . \n in contrast , the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculation expects the non-@xmath4 decay branching ratio to be at most approximately @xmath101  @xcite . \n meanwhile , an effective lagrangian approach estimates that the @xmath14 meson loop rescatterings into non-@xmath4 light vector and pseudoscalar mesons leads to approximately 1% non-@xmath4 branching ratios  @xcite . a similar calculation by ref .  \n @xcite also confirms such a nonperturbative phenomenon . \n one also notices that so far , most of the well - measured non-@xmath1 decay modes of @xmath2 are found to be rather small . \n namely , their branching ratios are either at the order of @xmath102 , or only an upper limit is set  @xcite .    \n taking all these facts into account and for the purpose of studying the dominant @xmath4 channel , we set @xmath100 to be zero in our fitting as a leading approximation . \n we have checked that the fitting results are approximately unchanged even though we set the non-@xmath1 branching ratio of the @xmath2 decay to be at the order of several percent .    \n .fitted parameters and fitting qualities with different @xmath71 . here , we use @xmath103 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .  [ \n born ] , we also present the born cross section @xmath89 for @xmath19 , which is denoted by the solid curve . \n the dashed and dotted lines are for the neutral and charged @xmath14-meson - pair born cross sections , respectively . combining the results shown in figs .  \n [ fitdiagram ] and  [ born ] , we find that the anomalous cross - section lineshape could originate from the interferences from the @xmath3 pole and @xmath4 final - state interactions . because the @xmath3 pole is relatively isolated due to its relatively narrow width in comparison with the mass gap between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , \n the relative phase between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 amplitudes is likely to be produced by the @xmath4 final - state interactions . \n although our calculation can not determine the absolute value for the possible non-@xmath4 decay branching ratio of @xmath2 , it is constructive to recognize the important role played by the final - state @xmath4 interactions that cause the deviation of the @xmath104 cross section in the @xmath2 mass region from a breit - wigner shape . \n this analysis is useful for our further understanding of the @xmath2 non-@xmath4 decays as a manifestation of possible nonperturbative qcd mechanisms .    to test the effect of the @xmath59 term \n , we can redo the fit by setting @xmath82 in the ms scheme . \n the fitted parameters and fitting quality are @xmath105 note that @xmath106 is more than two times larger than our previous result .    \n the fitted lineshape and exclusive contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath2 are presented in fig .  \n [ nof1fitdiagram ] . \n unsurprisingly , this figure shows that the contribution from @xmath3 is larger than that in the previous fitting in fig .  \n [ fitdiagram ] because of the larger coupling constant @xmath107 . \n the distorted lineshape can be explained by the interference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is constructive at @xmath108 but destructive at @xmath109 . \n this observation can help us conclude that a large @xmath110 will favor a larger value for @xmath47 , i.e. , a larger mass for @xmath2 than the present pdg average . \n we also find that , in this fitting , the fitted @xmath111 is sensitive to @xmath47 . \n for example , the best fit gives @xmath112 when we fix @xmath113 . by adopting the pdg values  @xcite for @xmath47 \n , the yield of @xmath111 can be even larger . \n furthermore , such a large @xmath106 suggests that we need to include the contact term @xmath59 in the @xmath1 interaction to saturate the contribution from @xmath3 . with this aspect taken into account \n , we can affirm that the fitting result with @xmath82 is not self - consistent . \n in general , the inclusion of the @xmath59 term seems to be necessary to yield a reasonable value for @xmath110 and , at the same time , determine @xmath114 in a range closer to the pdg average  @xcite .     \n ( left plot ) and @xmath115 ( right plot ) with @xmath116 . \n the solid line is the fitting result in our approach shown in fig.[feyndiagram ] , the dashed line shows the contribution from fig.[feyndiagram].(a ) , and the dotted line shows the contribution from fig.[feyndiagram].(b ) . \n the data are from bes@xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   ( left plot ) and @xmath115 ( right plot ) with @xmath116 . the solid line is the fitting result in our approach shown in fig.[feyndiagram ] , the dashed line shows the contribution from fig.[feyndiagram].(a ) , and the dotted line shows the contribution from fig.[feyndiagram].(b ) . \n the data are from bes@xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]     for @xmath19 with @xmath116 . \n the solid line is for @xmath117 , the dashed line is for @xmath118 , and the dotted line is for @xmath115.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    in summary , we have proposed an effective field theory for low - energy @xmath1 interactions in which we have included the resonance @xmath2 and an additional small scale @xmath119 . \n it is found that the coefficient of the contact term @xmath59 will be enhanced to be @xmath49 . \n therefore , the leading @xmath17 interaction potential in this specific channel would come from the @xmath120-channel @xmath2 exchange and the contact term @xmath59 . with the leading @xmath4 potential \n , we then sum the bubble diagrams to describe the @xmath1 final - state interaction as shown in fig .  \n [ feyndiagram ] . \n we find that we can describe the anomalous cross - section lineshape of @xmath121 observed by the besii collaboration  @xcite using the effective field theory . \n this approach should be useful for our further understanding of the @xmath2 non-@xmath4 decays , which could share the same dynamic origin as the @xmath4 cross - section lineshape anomaly as emphasized in refs .  \n @xcite .    \n we also test the effects of the contact term @xmath59 and find that , without this term , the extracted value of @xmath106 is too large to make the fitting self - consistent \n . nevertheless , the fitted @xmath2 mass is significantly larger than that in pdg  @xcite . \n our study also suggests that the subthreshold @xmath3 plays an important role in our understanding of the @xmath1 interactions . \n a better determination of @xmath106 should be strongly encouraged .     \n ( left plot ) and @xmath115 ( right plot ) . \n the solid line is the fitting result with @xmath122 and @xmath70 , the dashed line shows the contribution from @xmath2 , and the dotted line shows the contribution from @xmath3 . \n the data are from bes  @xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   ( left plot ) and @xmath115 ( right plot ) . \n the solid line is the fitting result with @xmath122 and @xmath70 , the dashed line shows the contribution from @xmath2 , and the dotted line shows the contribution from @xmath3 . \n the data are from bes  @xcite . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] "}
